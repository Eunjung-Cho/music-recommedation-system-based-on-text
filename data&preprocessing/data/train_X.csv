it was hot sizzling even at eight oclock  verona was coming to life people poured out of the houses and filled the streets while market traders set up their stalls in the grand piazza it was a good patch an excellent place to catch the business of those who lived and worked in the rich houses that lined veronas main square  the capulet mansion was one of the biggest  filled with servants and humming with activity it was an hour till breakfast and while the cooks sweated over the fires in the kitchen conjuring mouthwatering aromas of baked breads and hams the servingmen killed time as best they could  two of them  hot bored and restless  stepped out into the bustle of the piazza and swaggered about among the bright colours the animal smells and the din of traders voices hoping to find some action  i can tell you gregory said sampson im ready for them just watch me let a montague so much as put a foot in the piazza and youll see how quick i am  sure gregory knew that his friends boasts just added to the hot air around them  he loved winding the fiery sampson up so he said how quick you are to run away you mean  not from the montagues retorted sampson his face twisted with scorn ill take on any of their men  or women he added ,Act 1,Scene 1,Act 1Scene 1

ague servants stopped one of them a rather superior young man named abraham peered at sampson as though he were an insect he turned slowly to his companion with a query on his face his friend balthasar shrugged abraham turned back to sampson  are you biting your thumb at us he said  im biting my thumb as you can see said sampson  i can see that but are you biting your thumb at us  sampson leant over and whispered to his friend is the law on our side if i sayyes  gregory shook his head  no sampson straightened up im not biting my thumb at you  well said the montague thats alright then he knew as well as sampson what the penalty for starting a fight was peace to you then  the montagues were about to move on but the temptation was too much for sampson he couldnt let this chance pass  im definitely biting my thumb though he said  gregory forgetting the dangers in this moment of excitement stepped forward then and gave the montagues a hard look do you want to make something of it  abraham seemed to consider that for a moment then make something of ithe said calmly he turned his head and asked balthasar do we  balthasar dismissed the thought with a gesture  abraham shook his head slowly no we dont want to make anything of it  sam,Act 1,Scene 1,Act 1Scene 1
pson seeing that the montague men were about to walk on brought his face closer to abrahams and put on an even harder look because if you do he said speaking slowly im ready he stepped back leant his elbow on gregorys shoulder crossed one leg in front of the other and looked the montague servants up and down  abraham nodded signaled his friend to follow and turned to go  sampson didnt like to think that the fun was over he moved quickly to bar the montagues way i dont know who you think you are he told them ill have you know my masters just as good a man as yours is  not better though said abraham stopping again  well said sampson he knew that if he said his master was better it would be an unbearable insult there would be no going back so this was the critical moment  the four youths were in complete deadlock they stood staring at each other all of them itching to let fly when a well dressed young man emerged from one of the streets that led off the piazza  look whispered balthasar theres montagues cousin tell them our masters better  abraham had been controlling himself admirably until now but now the balance was tipped by the arrival of a montague the temptation was too great he tapped sampsons chest with his forefinger ,Act 1,Scene 1,Act 1Scene 1
