"Act 1, Scene 1","It was hot. Sizzling. Even at eight o¡¯clock.

Verona was coming to life: people poured out of the houses and filled the streets while market traders set up their stalls in the grand piazza. It was a good patch, an excellent place to catch the business of those who lived and worked in the rich houses that lined Verona¡¯s main square.

The Capulet mansion was one of the biggest ? filled with servants and humming with activity. It was an hour till breakfast and while the cooks sweated over the fires in the kitchen, conjuring mouthwatering aromas of baked breads and hams, the servingmen killed time as best they could.

Two of them ? hot, bored and restless ? stepped out into the bustle of the piazza and swaggered about among the bright colours, the animal smells and the din of traders¡¯ voices, hoping to find some action.

¡®I can tell you, Gregory,¡¯ said Sampson, ¡®I¡¯m ready for them. Just watch me. Let a Montague so much as put a foot in the piazza and you¡¯ll see how quick I am.¡¯

¡®Sure.¡¯ Gregory knew that his friend¡¯s boasts just added to the hot air around them.

He loved winding the fiery Sampson up, so he said: ¡®How quick you are to run away, you mean.¡¯

¡®Not from the Montagues.¡¯ retorted Sampson. His face twisted with scorn. ¡®I¡¯ll take on any of their men ? or women,¡¯ he added, winking.

¡®I know that¡¯s your level,¡¯ said Gregory, ¡®but our quarrel isn¡¯t with the women. Why quarrel with the women? This is between the men.¡¯

¡®Ha.¡¯ Sampson fancied himself quite seriously. ¡®When I¡¯ve dealt with the men I¡¯ll take care of the women.¡¯ He made a rude gesture with his arm. ¡®Don¡¯t you worry about that.¡¯

¡®Well here¡¯s your chance to show me,¡¯ said Gregory as two young servants dressed in the red and silver uniform of the Montagues came round a corner and on to the piazza.

With an exaggerated flourish Sampson put his hand on the hilt of his sword.

¡®Right,¡¯ he said. ¡®We¡¯re on. Pick a fight with them. I¡¯ll be right behind you.¡¯

¡®That¡¯s what I¡¯m afraid of,¡¯ said Gregory.

¡®No wait.¡¯ The Montague men were almost there. ¡®Be careful. We mustn¡¯t put ourselves in the wrong. Let them be the ones to start.¡¯

¡®Alright.¡¯ Gregory screwed his face up. They might as well have a bit of fun. It wouldn¡¯t come to anything serious. Just a bit of fun. ¡®I¡¯ll frown as we pass them. Let¡¯s see what they do.¡¯

¡®Good thinking,¡¯ said Sampson. ¡®And I¡¯ll bite my thumb at them. If they take that it will really show them up.¡¯

The Montague servants came closer. With Gregory¡¯s frowning and Sampson¡¯s pointed biting of his thumb they represented a very strange and obvious spectacle, which the Montagues couldn¡¯t ignore.

The Montague servants stopped. One of them, a rather superior young man named Abraham, peered at Sampson as though he were an insect. He turned slowly to his companion with a query on his face. His friend, Balthasar, shrugged. Abraham turned back to Sampson.

¡®Are you biting your thumb at us?¡¯ he said.

¡®I¡¯m biting my thumb, as you can see,¡¯ said Sampson.

¡®I can see that. But are you biting your thumb at us?¡¯

Sampson leant over and whispered to his friend: ¡®Is the law on our side if I say¡¯yes¡¯?¡¯

Gregory shook his head.

¡®No.¡¯ Sampson straightened up. ¡®I¡¯m not biting my thumb at you.¡¯

¡®Well,¡¯ said the Montague. ¡®That¡¯s alright then.¡¯ He knew as well as Sampson what the penalty for starting a fight was. ¡®Peace to you then.¡¯

The Montagues were about to move on but the temptation was too much for Sampson. He couldn¡¯t let this chance pass.

¡®I¡¯m definitely biting my thumb, though,¡¯ he said.

Gregory, forgetting the dangers in this moment of excitement, stepped forward then and gave the Montagues a hard look. ¡®Do you want to make something of it?¡¯

Abraham seemed to consider that for a moment. Then: ¡®Make something of it?¡¯he said calmly. He turned his head and asked Balthasar. ¡®Do we?¡¯

Balthasar dismissed the thought with a gesture.

Abraham shook his head slowly. ¡®No. We don¡¯t want to make anything of it.¡¯

Sampson, seeing that the Montague men were about to walk on, brought his face closer to Abraham¡¯s and put on an even harder look, ¡®Because if you do.¡¯ he said, speaking slowly, ¡®I¡¯m ready.¡¯ He stepped back, leant his elbow on Gregory¡¯s shoulder, crossed one leg in front of the other and looked the Montague servants up and down.

Abraham nodded, signaled his friend to follow, and turned to go.

Sampson didn¡¯t like to think that the fun was over. He moved quickly to bar the Montagues¡¯ way. ¡®I don¡¯t know who you think you are,¡¯ he told them. ¡®I¡¯ll have you know my master¡¯s just as good a man as yours is.¡¯

¡®Not better, though,¡¯ said Abraham, stopping again.

¡®Well.¡¯ said Sampson. He knew that if he said his master was better it would be an unbearable insult: there would be no going back, so this was the critical moment.

The four youths were in complete deadlock. They stood staring at each other, all of them itching to let fly, when a well dressed young man emerged from one of the streets that led off the piazza.

¡®Look,¡¯ whispered Balthasar. ¡®There¡¯s Montague¡¯s cousin. Tell them our master¡¯s better.¡¯

Abraham had been controlling himself admirably until now, but now the balance was tipped by the arrival of a Montague. The temptation was too great. He tapped Sampson¡¯s chest with his forefinger. ¡®There¡¯s something I have to tell you,¡¯ he said. ¡®My master¡¯s better than yours.¡¯

¡®You¡¯re a liar!¡¯ Sampson drew his sword. ¡®Come on, draw if you¡¯re men.¡¯

The Montague¡¯s swords were already in their hands. In an instant the four were fighting, their rapiers reflecting the morning sunlight in sharp bright flashes.

The well dressed youth was Montague¡¯s cousin, Benvolio, the last young man in Verona likely to become involved in a street fight. He was returning from an early morning walk. When he saw the fighting servants he started running towards them.

¡®Hey!¡¯ he shouted. ¡®Stop that! Put your swords away! You don¡¯t know what you¡¯re doing!

Stop it!¡¯ He drew his own rapier and charged in among them, trying to part them. ¡®Stop!¡¯
he yelled. ¡®Stop it!¡¯

A crowd had gathered, attracted by the shouting. Among them was the fiery nephew of Capulet himself. He was a restless young fellow called Tybalt. Unlike Benvolio, he couldn¡¯t resist a fight. The mere sight of a Montague was enough to make his blood boil.

¡®Hey, Benvolio,¡¯ he called. ¡®Fancy finding you fighting with servants. Why don¡¯t you pick on a man?¡¯ When Benvolio ignored him he drew his sword and touched the young Montague¡¯s shoulder with it. ¡®Turn,¡¯ he said dramatically, ¡®And face your death.¡¯

¡®Forget it, Tybalt.¡¯ panted Benvolio. He didn¡¯t take Tybalt¡¯s frequent theatrical displays seriously at the best of times and now, while he was trying to stop these hot blooded young men from fighting, he wasn¡¯t in the mood for Tybalt¡¯s nonsense at all. He shrugged the end of the young Capulet¡¯s sword from his shoulder.

¡®I¡¯m trying to keep the peace. Put your sword away. Or use it to help me part these men.¡¯

¡®What?¡¯ said Tybalt. ¡®A sword in your hand and talking about  peace? Don¡¯t make me laugh. I hate that word. Just as I hate all Montagues. And especially you!¡¯ And with that he made a lunge at Benvolio, forcing him to turn and defend himself.

The four servants were still fighting and others had joined in. More people were pouring out of the houses around the piazza and the narrow streets that led off it. The fighters were trampling over stalls, squashing fruit and sending chickens and piglets squawking and squealing in panic.

An officer of the city¡¯s Watch arrived. Waving his longsword above his head he shouted to the people to help him part the fighters. ¡®These damned Capulets!¡¯ he stormed. ¡®These damned Montagues. Curse them all! Down with the lot of ¡¯em!¡¯

By now the whole piazza was in turmoil. Some people fought while others tried to stop them. Wounded men squirmed in the dust and market stalls lay in ruins.

Capulet came running on to a balcony of his house, followed by his wife. He still wore his nightgown. ¡®What¡¯s this racket?¡¯ he said. ¡®Get me my longsword¡¯¡¯

¡®Don¡¯t be absurd,¡¯ said Lady Capulet. ¡®You need a crutch, more like it. What would you do with a sword?¡¯
But Capulet meant it. He could see his enemy, Montague, down in the piazza, waving his sword at him, taunting him ? challenging him to come out and fight. ¡®Get me my sword!¡¯ he demanded.

Montague was shouting up at him. ¡®You villain, Capulet! Come out and fight like a man.¡¯ Lady Montague was pulling him back, trying to calm him down. ¡®Let go,¡¯ he yelled, as she gripped his cloak even more tightly. ¡®Leave me alone. Come on, Capulet! Come on, then!¡¯

¡®Stop it,¡¯ cried Lady Montague. ¡®I won¡¯t let you fight. What do you think you¡¯re doing? At your age!¡¯

Just as Montague broke loose from his wife¡¯s grasp and was rushing to meet Capulet, who had answered his challenge by coming out to the piazza, still in his nightgown, there was the furious brassy sound of trumpets ? dozens of them. Every citizen knew what that fanfare meant. Even Tybalt, although at an advantage in his fight with Benvolio, lowered his sword and turned towards the palace that dominated the piazza with its huge columns and vast porch. The Prince himself, accompanied by scores of his courtiers and officers, was hurrying down the stairs.

The fanfare died away and silence spread across the piazza. Everyone watched as the Prince strode to the fountain and stepped up on to the wall. He looked around at his subjects. His face was solemn. His stern gaze fell on Montague and Capulet who stood side by side, their swords still drawn. He looked at them for a long time before he spoke. Then:

¡®This is the third time that you, Capulet, and you, Montague, have disturbed the tranquillity of our city and obliged the elders of Verona to make peace between you,¡¯ he said. He paused and allowed his eyes to roam over the devastation. ¡®It seems it hasn¡¯t worked. You are both so blighted with hatred.¡¯ His eyes flashed with anger. ¡®So this is what I¡¯m going to order. If you ever disturb our streets again you¡¯ll pay for it with your lives.¡¯

A murmur went up among the crowd. The Prince had never gone this far. But by the look of him he meant it! He was sick and tired of this stupid feud between two of Verona¡¯s wealthiest families and now he was going to do something about it at last. And they all knew that he meant it.

¡®Now go home, all of you,¡¯ he ordered his subjects.

¡®Wait, Capulet,¡¯ he said as Capulet turned to go. ¡®You will come with me. And you, Montague, come and see me this afternoon: I¡¯ll let you know then what else I¡¯ve decided. Now all of you, go home.¡¯

Within five minutes the only people left were the wounded and the market traders who, with varying degrees of stoicism, began to put their stalls back together. The injured were trying to pick themselves up: if they didn¡¯t hurry the Prince¡¯s guards would begin rounding them up.

Benvolio walked to the Montague house with his uncle and aunt. Fortunately he wasn¡¯t hurt, although his thoughts about Tybalt were not the most generous.

¡®What happened¡¯?¡¯ said Montague. Were you there when it started?¡¯¡¯

Benvolio explained about the servants and about the way Tybalt had attacked him ? how Tybalt¡¯s sword had whistled round his head so that there was no way he could have ignored it.

Lady Montague wasn¡¯t interested in how it had started. All she felt was relief at knowing her son hadn¡¯t been involved. ¡®Where is he?¡¯ she said. ¡®Have you seen him today?¡¯

¡®Who?¡¯

¡®Romeo. Have you seen him?¡¯

Benvolio smiled. ¡®I think he¡¯s avoiding me. I couldn¡¯t sleep last night and I got up early, before dawn. I went for a walk ? to the sycamore grove on the outskirts of the city.¡¯

He pointed down the alley that ran along the side of Montague¡¯s house. ¡®And he was there. I called to him but as soon as he heard me he dived into the woods. He didn¡¯t want to talk to me. Well, I had my own problems, so I dropped it.¡¯

¡®Hmm,¡¯ said Montague. ¡®I¡¯ve heard that he often goes there before dawn. They tell me he does a lot of crying. And as soon as the sun comes up he hurries home, goes to his room and closes the shutters. Something¡¯s definitely wrong.¡¯

¡®Have you any idea why he¡¯s acting so strangely?¡¯ said Benvolio.

¡®Not the slightest,¡¯ said Montague. ¡®He hasn¡¯t said anything to me.¡¯

¡®Have you asked him?¡¯

¡®I have. and I¡¯ve got others to as well. He¡¯s become very secretive. How can I help him if he won¡¯t say anything?¡¯

As they were going in Benvolio caught sight of Romeo coming up the street.

¡®There he is!¡¯ he said. ¡®Go in. I¡¯ll wait for him. I¡¯m determined to get to the bottom of this.¡¯

¡®Bless you,¡¯ said his aunt.

¡®Come on.¡¯ said her husband. ¡®Good luck, Benvolio.¡¯

Benvolio strolled slowly down the street. ¡®Hi.¡¯ he said as he got near to Romeo.

He bent his head and tried to catch his cousin¡¯s eye. ¡®Good morning.¡¯

Romeo pretended not to see him. Benvolio bent his head even further and looked right up into his cousin¡¯s lowered eyes so that Romeo couldn¡¯t ignore him any longer.

¡®Good morning,¡¯ said Benvolio.

Romeo sighed a long, deep, mournful sigh. ¡®Is the day so young?¡¯

¡®Only just gone nine.¡¯

¡®Oh dear,¡¯ said Romeo. He sighed again. ¡®How the time drags when you¡¯re sad. Was that my father I just saw ducking into the house?¡¯

¡®It was.¡¯ said Benvolio. ¡®What kind of sadness is this that makes the time drag so?¡¯

¡®Not having what I need to make it go fast.¡¯

¡®Not in love¡¦!¡¯

¡®No, out.¡¯

¡®Out of love?¡¯

¡®Out of the favour of the girl I love.¡¯

¡®Dear oh dear.¡¯ said Benvolio, trying not to laugh. ¡®It¡¯s a hard life. That love, such a gentle thing, should be so rough when it comes down to it.¡¯

¡®Yes,¡¯ said Romeo. ¡®I don¡¯t want to talk about it. Where shall we go for lunch?¡¯

As they got to the corner Romeo stopped. He saw the broken awnings, the traders still chasing their chickens and piglets, and wounded men hobbling away.

¡®What happened?¡¯ he said. But before Benvolio could answer he sighed yet again. ¡®Don¡¯t tell me.¡¯ He shook his head sadly. ¡®I know all about it. This is about hatred.

But I¡¯m thinking only about love. Oh, everything is upside down.¡¯ He looked sharply at Benvolio. ¡®Are you laughing at me?¡¯

¡®Would I do that?¡¯ said Benvolio. ¡®You make me want to cry.¡¯

¡®Why?¡¯

¡®Because you¡¯re so pathetic.¡¯

¡®It¡¯s love that makes me pathetic,¡¯ said his cousin. ¡®But don¡¯t give it another thought. You¡¯ve got more to think about.¡¯ His eyes filled with tears. ¡®If you start feeling sorry for me it¡¯ll only make things worse. So goodbye.¡¯

¡®Hold on.¡¯ said Benvolio. ¡®I¡¯ll walk with you.¡¯

¡®Where to? I¡¯m not here. This isn¡¯t me. I have lost myself. Romeo¡¯s somewhere else.¡¯

¡®Aright,¡¯ said Benvolio. ¡®Be serious. Tell me who it is.¡¯

¡®I can¡¯t bear to say her name.¡¯

¡®Come on.¡¯

¡®Well, I¡¯ll tell you. She¡¯s a girl.¡¯

¡®Oh. well done.¡¯ said Benvolio. ¡®I assumed that when you said you were in love.¡¯

¡®And she¡¯s beautiful.¡¯

¡®Good for you.¡¯

¡®But she doesn¡¯t want to know.¡¯ Romeo took out a handkerchief and dabbed at his eyes. ¡®She¡¯s not interested in boys: says she never will be. She won¡¯t listen to anything I say. When our eyes meet she looks the other way. I¡¯ve even offered her money.¡¯

¡®Well. She¡¯s determined not to have a man.¡¯

¡®Oh God,¡¯ said Romeo. ¡®Such a waste. She¡¯s so beautiful, Benvolio. And she¡¯ll go through life alone and when she dies all beauty will die with her. She says she¡¯ll never love anyone so I¡¯m destined for a living death.¡¯
Benvolio grasped Romeo¡¯s wrist. ¡®Will you trust me? I can tell you how to forget her.¡¯

¡®How?¡¯ said Romeo. ¡®Impossible. Tell me how.¡¯

¡®Simple,¡¯ said Benvolio. ¡®Get out and about. Look at other girls.¡¯

¡®It¡¯s no good.¡¯ said Romeo. ¡®Whenever I see a beautiful girl from now on I¡¯ll only think of one who is even more beautiful. Goodbye Benvolio. There¡¯s no way I could forget her. There¡¯s nothing you can do.¡¯
¡®I¡¯m taking that as a challenge,¡¯ said Benvolio. ¡®I¡¯ll sort it out, don¡¯t you worry.¡¯

"
"Act 1, Scene 2","¡®No,¡¯ Capulet told his visitor. ¡®It¡¯s six of one and half a dozen of the other. ¡®We¡¯re both bound over to keep the peace. One as much as the other. And I don¡¯t think it¡¯s so difficult for men of our age.¡¯

His visitor, the young Count of Paris, shrugged. ¡®You¡¯re both respectable men. It¡¯s a pity you¡¯ve had to live your lives as enemies.¡¯ He wasn¡¯t interested in the relationship between the two families. It was a bit distasteful, this public brawling. But Capulet was rich and his daughter was very desirable. ¡®Let¡¯s get down to business,¡¯ he said. ¡®What do you say to my proposition?¡¯

Capulet paced back and forth for a while, stopped and stared out the window then turned back to the young man.

¡®Look.¡¯ he said. ¡®I can only tell you what I¡¯ve already intimated. My daughter is still a child: she¡¯s not fourteen yet. Give it time. In a couple of years she¡¯ll be just about ready for marriage.¡¯

¡®Many girls younger than her are mothers already,¡¯ said Paris.

¡®And their lives are ruined,¡¯ said Capulet. ¡®My daughter is very special to me.

She¡¯s my only surviving child. All my hopes rest on her. Do you understand what I¡¯m saying?¡¯ He put his hand on the young man¡¯s shoulder. ¡®I¡¯ll tell you what. Let¡¯s agree to a compromise. Take it slowly, Paris. Gain her confidence. If she agrees to marry you then my consent will follow. And my blessing too.¡¯

Paris thought for a moment then nodded. They shook hands.

¡®That¡¯s settled then.¡¯ Capulet moved briskly to his desk. ¡®And now to pleasure. Tonight I¡¯m having a party. There are going to be a lot of people. All friends of mine ? among which I count you, of course. Why don¡¯t you join us? I can promise you, my humble house will be filled with gorgeous girls. And I mean gorgeous. Real stars.¡¯ He winked. ¡®Make yourself at home: look at them, talk to them, dance with them. Perhaps you¡¯ll even like one of them better than my daughter. It¡¯s alright with me if you do. Marriage is a big step: you have to be sure. No use rushing these things.¡¯

He turned to the doorway. ¡®Peter!¡¯ he called. ¡®Come in here, please.¡¯

A young servant hurried in, drying his hands on his shirt as he came.

¡®Jump to it,¡¯ said Capulet. He took a sheet of paper off his desk and handed it to the young servant. ¡®Go on, take it. I want you to go all around Verona and find the people on this list. Tell them they¡¯re invited to my party tonight.¡¯

Peter waited until he was out in the piazza before he could bring himself to look at the list. It was the first time he¡¯d ever been given a job like this. Find the people whose names are written on a list? It wouldn¡¯t be so bad if he could read! He had managed to cover up his ignorance until now but this was a hard one. He¡¯d have to find an educated person and ask him. He looked about him. Two gentlemen were walking towards him.

They passed him and he followed them, listening to their conversation.

¡®Come on, man,¡¯ the first one said. ¡®One fire can put another one out. Infect yourself with a new disease and it will kill the old ailment.¡¯

¡®Sure,¡¯ said the second. ¡®For your ailment we¡¯ll just use a herbal remedy.¡¯

¡®What?¡¯ said the first. ¡®Herbal remedy? What for?¡¯

¡®For the broken leg you¡¯re going to get if you don¡¯t shut up.¡¯

Peter increased his pace. He¡¯d ask these two. They sounded educated enough: he couldn¡¯t understand a word they were saying. ¡®Excuse me.¡¯ he said. ¡®Can you read?¡¯

They stopped. ¡®Yes,¡¯ said the sad looking one. He sighed ¡®I can read my own fate in my unhappiness.¡¯

¡®Perhaps you¡¯ve learnt that off by heart,¡¯ said Peter. ¡®But can you read by sight?¡¯

¡®Yes, if I recognize the letters and the language,¡¯ said the gentleman. The other one laughed.

¡®Alright, forget it,¡¯ said Peter. He wasn¡¯t going to get anywhere with them. They were mad. He¡¯d find someone else. ¡®Thanks anyway.¡¯ He began walking away.

¡®Wait,¡¯ said the sad gentleman. ¡®I¡¯m only joking. Of course I can read.¡¯ He took the sheet and began reading.
¡®Signior Martino. and his wife and daughters: Count Anselme¡¦¡¯ It was only a list of names. ¡®Mercutio. Hmm. See here. Benvolio. Mercutio¡¯s on this list.¡¯

¡®My uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters: my fair niece Rosaline.¡¯ He paused at that, held the sheet dramatically to his chest and sighed. Then he read on to the end. ¡®A lot of people on this list.¡¯ he said. ¡®What¡¯s it for?¡¯

¡®A party,¡¯ said Peter.

¡®Where?¡¯

¡®My master¡¯s house.¡¯

¡®And who¡¯s he?¡¯

¡®The great rich Capulet. Everyone¡¯s invited. As long as you ¡®re not a Montague you ¡®re welcome.¡¯ He snatched the sheet. ¡®Cheers.¡¯

¡®Aha!¡¯ said Benvolio when Peter had gone. ¡®Rosaline¡¯s going to be there, I see.

Among some of the most luscious girls in Verona. Let¡¯s go to Capulet¡¯s party, Romeo.

No-one will mind. And let¡¯s be objective about it. I¡¯ll show you that the girl you think is a swan is nothing more than a crow.¡¯

¡®A girl more beautiful than Rosaline?¡¯ said Romeo. ¡®Never. The sun¡¯s never seen a more beautiful woman since the world began.¡¯

¡®Rubbish,¡¯ said Benvolio. ¡®Every time you¡¯ve seen her she¡¯s been on her own.

You need to make comparisons. I¡¯ll bet there¡¯ll be hundreds of girls who¡¯ll put Rosaline in the shade.¡¯

¡®Alright, I¡¯ll go,¡¯ said Romeo. ¡®But not because I think you can show me anyone better. I¡¯m going only so that I can see her.¡¯"
"Act 1, Scene 3","Lady Capulet came into the sitting room where her daughter¡¯s nurse was sewing a pattern on to a handkerchief.
¡®Nurse.¡¯ she said. ¡®Where¡¯s my daughter? I want to talk to her.¡¯

¡®She¡¯s just here.¡¯ said the Nurse. She turned her head. ¡®Lady-bird!¡¯ she called.

¡®My lamb! Where is that girl? Juliet!¡¯

¡®Coming,¡¯ a voice called and Juliet came running in from an adjoining room.

When she saw her mother her face showed surprise. ¡®Mother! What do you want?¡¯

¡®We need to talk,¡¯ said Lady Capulet. ¡®Nurse. leave us. This is a private matter.¡¯

The nurse got up reluctantly but before she reached the door Lady Capulet called her back. ¡®You might as well stay,¡¯ she said. ¡®Your advice would be helpful.¡¯ Lady Capulet cleared her throat. ¡®You know Juliet¡¯s getting to the age when¡¦¡¯ She frowned, searching for the right word. ¡®Let¡¯s just say she¡¯s at a pretty age. She¡¯s going to be fourteen in two weeks.¡¯

¡®Oh yes,¡¯ said the Nurse. ¡®At Lammas Eve she¡¯ll be fourteen. She was the same age as my Susan, God rest her soul. Anyway, at Lammas Eve she¡¯ll be fourteen. I remember it so well: it¡¯s eleven years since the earthquake ? that¡¯s when she was weaned. Ah, I¡¯ll never forget it¡¦¡¯

She took no notice of the impatient tapping of Lady Capulet¡¯s fingers on the table, nor the glances Lady Capulet and Juliet were exchanging.

¡®You and my Lord were at Mantua then. I had put wormwood on my nipple ? sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall ? ah, how well I remember it. But as I said, when she tasted the wormwood on the nipple of my breast, tasted its bitterness, she spat my breast out and pulled such a face! And that was eleven years ago. She could walk already ? waddle, rather -and she used to rush about and fall over. Just the day before that she fell on her face. And my husband, God be with his soul ? ah, such a lovely man ? he picked her up and said ¡°Do you fall on your face? When you¡¯ve got more sense you¡¯ll fall on your back. won¡¯t you Jule?¡± And God can strike me dead but the little wretch stopped crying and said ¡°Yes¡±. To see that! If I live to be a thousand I¡¯ll never forget it. ¡°Won¡¯t you Jule?¡± he said. And the pretty child stopped crying and said
¡°yes¡±.¡¯ The Nurse slapped her thigh and laughed. ¡®Won¡¯t you, Jule?¡¯ he said. And the pretty fool stopped in her tracks and said ¡°yes¡±.¡¯

¡®Enough of this.¡¯ said Lady Capulet. ¡®Please be quiet for a minute, I beg of you.¡¯

¡®Yes, Madam,¡¯ said the Nurse. ¡®But I can¡¯t help laughing. To think it should stop crying and say ¡°yes¡±. And with a bump as big as an egg ? a wicked lump ? and it cried bitterly. ¡°Yes¡±, my husband said. ¡°Are you falling on your face? You¡¯ll fall backward when you grow up: won¡¯t you Jule?¡± It stopped dead and said ¡°Yes¡±.¡¯ The Nurse laughed loudly, almost choking.

¡®And you stop dead now too, please, Nurse,¡¯ said Juliet.

¡®I¡¯ve finished,¡¯ said the Nurse. She looked tenderly at Juliet. ¡®But I must say it. You were the most beautiful baby I ever nursed. If I could only live to see you married I¡¯d die peacefully.¡¯

¡®Married.¡¯ said Lady Capulet. ¡®That¡¯s just what I¡¯ve come to talk about.¡¯ She pulled Juliet on to her lap. ¡®Tell me, Juliet, how do you feel about getting married?¡¯

¡®I¡¯ve never even thought about it,¡¯ said Juliet.

¡®Well start thinking about it now,¡¯ said her mother. ¡®Girls younger than you are already mothers here in Verona. As a matter of fact I was your mother when I was much the age you are now. But to cut a long story short. The Count of Paris wants to marry you.¡¯

The Nurse gasped. ¡®Now there¡¯s a man, young lady. The perfect man.¡¯

¡®The best in Verona,¡¯ said Lady Capulet.

¡®Without doubt.¡¯ said the Nurse.

¡®Well?¡¯ said Lady Capulet. ¡®Do you think you could love him?¡¯

Juliet didn¡¯t know what to say. It was too unexpected.

¡®You¡¯ll see him at the party,¡¯ said her mother. ¡®Have a good look at him. You¡¯ll see what I mean. And he has sound prospects. By having him you¡¯ll have everything.¡¯

The Nurse laughed her coarse laugh again. ¡®You¡¯ll have even more than that. Everyone knows that women grow bigger by having a man.¡¯

Lady Capulet ignored her. ¡®Come on,¡¯ she said. ¡®What do you think? Do you like the idea?¡¯

Juliet spoke carefully. ¡®I¡¯ll look forward to seeing him. Yes. I¡¯ll look at him but I¡¯m not going to rush into anything or do anything that you wouldn¡¯t want me to.¡¯

There was a knock at the door and Peter came in. ¡®Madam,¡¯ he said. ¡®The guests are starting to arrive. It¡¯s all going on down there. My master wants you.¡¯

Lady Capulet stood up. ¡®I have to go. Come on Juliet, the Count¡¯s waiting.

¡®Go on, darling.¡¯ said the Nurse. ¡®Go and meet your love.¡¯"
"Act 1, Scene 4","¡®Are we going to make some excuse for coming without being invited?¡¯ said Romeo. ¡®Or shall we just go in and see what happens?

They stood in the piazza. watching the huge front door of Capulet¡¯s mansion.

People were arriving and being let in. Mercutio, the one with the invitation, and Romeo¡¯s best friend, even though he was related to the Capulets, sat on the ground, humming ? pretending to be above the debate. He was making the point that he was the only one to have been invited.

¡®No speeches,¡¯ said Benvolio. ¡®Speeches are out. No-one makes speeches any more. We¡¯ll just go in. Too bad if they don¡¯t like us.¡¯

Horatio nodded. There was no need to draw attention to themselves.

¡®Alright, then,¡¯ said Romeo. He sighed. ¡®Give me the torch, Horatio. I¡¯ll carry it: I¡¯m not going to dance.¡¯

¡®Oh no you don¡¯t,¡¯ said Mercutio, shooing Horatio away. ¡®You¡¯re dancing. That¡¯s the whole point.¡¯

Romeo sat down beside his friend and sighed. ¡®I¡¯m not in the mood.¡¯

¡®Come on,¡¯ said Mercutio. ¡®You¡¯re a lover. Lovers are always in the mood for dancing.¡¯

¡®Not me. It¡¯s because of love that I¡¯m not in the mood. I¡¯m too heavy-hearted for dancing.¡¯

Mercutio laughed. ¡®What an act. What a fuss about nothing.¡¯

The others laughed with him and made fun of Romeo.

¡®So love¡¯s nothing now, is it?¡¯ Romeo¡¯s face showed that he was offended. ¡®You don¡¯t know what it¡¯s like until you¡¯ve felt it. It hurts like hell.¡¯

¡®Snap out of it then. And it will stop hurting.¡¯ Mercutio got up. ¡®Hand me a mask, Benvolio. Let¡¯s go¡¯

¡®Come on, then,¡¯ said Benvolio. ¡®It¡¯s getting late.¡¯ They gathered round him. ¡®Now as soon as we¡¯re in let¡¯s all get down to some serious business.¡¯

¡®I¡¯ll take the torch,¡¯ said Romeo. ¡®I told you. I¡¯m not dancing. I¡¯m just going to watch.¡¯

He hung back and Mercutio put his arm around his shoulders. ¡®Come on,¡¯ he coaxed. ¡®We¡¯re wasting time.¡¯

Romeo was reluctant. ¡®I know we mean no harm and all that but I don¡¯t think it¡¯s very bright to go to this party.¡¯

¡®Why?¡¯ said Mercutio.

¡®I had a dream last night.¡¯

His friends groaned.

¡®Let¡¯s go,¡¯ said Benvolio, ¡®If we don¡¯t get a move on all the food will be gone by the time we get there.¡¯
People were arriving in droves. The doors were opening and closing every few seconds.

¡®I have this feeling,¡¯ said Romeo. ¡®A strong premonition that something¡¯s going to happen. Something¡¯s going to happen tonight. I feel it¡¯s going to end in my having to repay a debt with my life.¡¯

The others looked at each other, throwing their eyes up and shaking their heads.

Romeo shrugged. ¡®Alright then, off we go.¡¯"
"Act 2, Scene 1","Romeo couldn¡¯t bear to leave the house where he had been so soundly struck down. Each step he took would carry him further away from Juliet. He couldn¡¯t go just like that. His heart was here ? nowhere else. And he knew what would happen on the way home. They would mock him. He could do without that. They would go on about Rosaline. Rosaline? Who was Rosaline?

¡®Romeo! Hey Romeo!¡¯ They were right behind him. He pressed himself against the hard stone wall as though trying to find a hiding place among its crevices.

¡®Romeo!¡¯

¡®Cousin!¡¯

¡®Oh Ro-me-o! Ro-ho-ho-me-o!¡¯

They were coming closer. In desperation Romeo searched for a foothold and found one. He pushed himself up the wall. Another foothold, and another, and before he knew it he was on top of the high wall. He lay flat on his stomach, holding his breath.

They stopped right beneath him.

¡®I swear he¡¯s run off home to avoid us,¡¯ he heard Mercutio say. ¡®He¡¯ll be in bed by now.¡¯

¡®No.¡¯ said Benvolio. ¡®He was here a moment ago. I¡¯ll bet he climbed over this orchard
wall. Call him again, Mercutio.¡¯

¡®He¡¯s disappeared.¡¯ said Mercutio. ¡®Like a ghost. Hey, he¡¯s a ghost. Let¡¯s see if I can conjure him up.¡¯

Romeo lay, trying not to breathe, listening to their drunken giggling. There was some whispering, then Mercutio¡¯s voice rang out again.

¡®Romeo! Madman!¡¯ There was more giggling. ¡®Lover! Appear to me! Appear in the form of a¡¦ sigh!¡¯

Romeo held his breath.

¡®Say something.¡¯ called Mercutio. ¡®Anything.¡¯ More whispering and loud laughing.

¡®I conjure you in the name of Rosaline¡¯s bright eyes!¡¯ Mercutio spoke in the formal tone of a priest. ¡®By her high forehead. And her scarlet lip.¡¯

Benvolio and Horatio hooted.

¡®By her fine foot, straight leg¡¦¡¯ More giggles. ¡®And quivering thighs!¡¯ Yells of delight from the others.

¡®And everything else in that region!¡¯ Raucous laughter.

¡®That you appear to us in the likeness of ? of -¡¯ The other two made animal noises.

¡®The likeness of yourself!¡¯ said Mercutio

¡®Shhh.¡¯ said Benvolio, trying to stop laughing. ¡®If he hears you he¡¯ll be furious.¡¯

¡®How could that make him furious¡¯?¡¯ said Mercutio. ¡®Raising him in the name of his beloved? That¡¯s fair enough. isn¡¯t it? I¡¯m only trying to¡¦ raise him.¡¯

¡®It¡¯s no use.¡¯ said Benvolio when he had stopped laughing. ¡®I think he¡¯s hiding in the orchard. Leave him. Since love is blind he¡¯s best off in the dark.¡¯

¡®If that¡¯s so, it¡¯s no wonder he can¡¯t hit his target,¡¯ said Mercutio. ¡®Meaning Rosaline.¡¯ He yawned. ¡®Oh well. Goodnight to Romeo. I need my bed. Shall we go without him?¡¯

¡®Might as well.¡¯ said Benvolio. ¡®You¡¯ll never find someone who doesn¡¯t want to be found.¡¯"
"Act 2, Scene 2","Romeo sat up. The moon was huge: it cast a silvery light over everything. The wall he was on ran from the front of the mansion they¡¯d just left and he realized he was on Capulet¡¯s property. On one side of the wall was the narrow alley where his friends had been. On the other was an orchard. The back of the house loomed dark and forbidding.

She was in there somewhere. What was she doing¡¯? Was she thinking about him?

It was alright for Mercutio. He¡¯d never felt the pain of love. It was easy for him to joke about it.

A light came on in a window. Perhaps it was her! Lighting the world like the morning sun! She was the sun, so much more beautiful than the goddess of the night, the moon. As though in answer to his wishes a door opened and she came out on to a balcony.
¡®It¡¯s her!¡¯ he whispered. ¡®Oh, it¡¯s my love.¡¯

He wished she could know he was there, sitting on the wall, watching her. Her lips were moving but he couldn¡¯t hear what she was saying. Anyway, she couldn¡¯t be talking to him.

As he stared at her he tried to understand how anyone could be so beautiful. It was as though the two most radiant stars in the sky had business somewhere else and had begged her eyes to take their place while they were away. It was as though they had changed places and the stars were in her head, her eyes in the heavens.

But even then, the beauty of her cheek would dim those eyes in the same way as daylight overwhelms a lamp. Her eyes would shine so brightly in the heavens that birds would start singing, thinking it was daytime.

As he watched she leant her cheek on her hand! Oh how he wished he could be a glove on that hand so that he could touch that cheek! Oh how¡¦!

She sighed loudly.

He had to get closer. He jumped. At any other time he might have hurt himself but now he didn¡¯t even feel the ground as he landed. All he was thinking was that he wanted her to speak again. She was an angel. Wherever she was the night would be lit up. He crept through the shadows of the orchard until he stood behind a tree that grew directly beneath the balcony.

She sighed again. ¡®Oh Romeo, Romeo,¡¯ she said. ¡®Why are you Romeo? I wish you could stop being a Montague. Or if you won¡¯t, just say you love me and I¡¯ll stop being a Capulet.¡¯

Romeo wanted to show himself to her but he also wanted to hear more so he controlled himself and listened, not daring to breathe.

¡®It¡¯s only your name that¡¯s my enemy.¡¯ she continued. ¡®You¡¯re still what you are, Montague or no Montague.¡¯

She paused. He wanted to rush out and say ¡®Look down here!¡¯ but she spoke again.

¡®Anyway, what¡¯s ¡°Montague¡±? It¡¯s not as though it¡¯s a hand or a foot, or an arm or a face, or anything like that. Oh I wish you could be some other name. What¡¯s in a name, anyway? The flower that we call a rose would smell as sweet whatever we called it. Whatever name Romeo had it wouldn¡¯t make any difference: he would still be everything that¡¯s perfect. Oh Romeo, throw your name out and take all of me instead.¡¯

Romeo couldn¡¯t stand it any more. He sprang from behind the tree and raised his arms. ¡®I¡¯ll take you at your word,¡¯ he said. ¡®Just call me ¡®Love¡¯ and that will be my new name. From now on I¡¯m not Romeo.¡¯

She drew back. It was such a shock to hear someone out there that she didn¡¯t listen to what he was saying.

¡®Who are you?¡¯ she said. ¡®Coming here in the dark, watching me and eavesdropping like this?¡¯

¡®I¡¯m afraid to tell you my name,¡¯ he said. ¡®I hate my name because you hate it. If I had written it I would tear the word up.¡¯
She recognized his voice. ¡®Aren¡¯t you Romeo? And a Montague¡¯?¡¯

¡®Neither,¡¯ he said, ¡®Since you dislike both names.¡¯

¡®How did you get here? Tell me that. And why? The orchard walls are high, and hard to climb. And this place is dangerous, considering who you are. If any of my family finds you here¡¦¡¯

¡®I flew over the wall,¡¯ he said. ¡®With the wings of love. Stone walls can¡¯t keep love out. Love can¡¯t be stopped so how could your family stop me?¡¯

¡®If they see you they¡¯ll kill you!¡¯

¡®Your eyes are more powerful than twenty of their swords. Just give me a loving look and I¡¯ll be invincible.¡¯

She looked around. ¡®I don¡¯t want them to see you here.¡¯

¡®It¡¯s alright, it¡¯s dark. Anyway, if you don¡¯t love me I¡¯d rather be caught by them than live without your love.¡¯

¡®Who told you where to find me?¡¯

Romeo found it impossible to be serious. ¡®Love told me. I¡¯m no navigator, but even if you were living on the far side of the furthest ocean I would find my way to you.¡¯

¡®It¡¯s a good thing it¡¯s dark,¡¯ she said. ¡®Or you would see me blushing. Because of what you overheard. I would love to be able to deny that I said those things but I¡¯m not going to pretend. Do you love me?¡¯

At that Romeo really felt he was flying. He opened his mouth to tell her but she was rushing on.

¡®I know you¡¯ll say ¡®yes¡¯. And I¡¯ll take your word for it. But if you swear too much you may not stick to it. Please don¡¯t let that happen.¡¯ She leant forward, over the balustrade. ¡®Oh Romeo, if you do love me, please tell me honestly.¡¯ She moved back a little. ¡®Or if you think I¡¯m too fast tell me and I¡¯ll put on an act and be all coy and play hard to get. I¡¯m so much in love with you: that¡¯s why I¡¯m being so forward. But I promise you, I¡¯ll be more loving and faithful than those who are reserved. I should have been all shy, I know, and would have if you hadn¡¯t overheard my real feelings. So forgive me. And don¡¯t think I¡¯m taking it lightly.¡¯

¡®I swear by the moon¡¦¡¯

¡®Oh don¡¯t swear by the moon! The moon¡¯s too changeable.¡¯

¡®What shall I swear by?¡¯

¡®Don¡¯t swear at all,¡¯ she said. ¡®But if you must, swear by your self. You¡¯re the god I worship. Swear by your self and I¡¯ll believe you. No, don¡¯t swear. Although I love you I don¡¯t like this ? making commitments like this. It¡¯s too sudden, too fast. It¡¯s not a good idea. It¡¯s like lightning ? gone too quickly. I¡¯ll say goodnight. This bud of love may grow into a lovely flower by the time we meet again.¡¯ She stepped back and stood beside the door. ¡®Good night.¡¯

Romeo couldn¡¯t understand this. What was she doing? ¡®Just like that?¡¯ he said.

¡®Are you just going to leave it like that?¡¯

¡®What more could we do tonight¡¯?¡¯ she said, coming forward again.

¡®Make faithful vows of love,¡¯ he said.

¡®I gave you mine before you asked for it. And yet I wish I had it back.¡¯

¡®Do you want to take it back? Why?¡¯

¡®To be honest, so that I can give it to you again. But I have so much love for you: the more I give the more I have. It¡¯s like the sea ? without end.¡¯

The Nurse¡¯s voice intruded into their conversation. ¡®Juliet? Lamb? Honey Love?¡¯

¡®I¡¯m just coming, Nurse,¡¯ she called. She turned back to Romeo. ¡®Beloved Montague, be true to me.¡¯ He thought she had gone but she whispered to him: ¡®Wait there. I¡¯ll be back.¡¯

¡®Oh night! Oh beautiful night,¡¯ he said. He blew kisses at the moon. It couldn¡¯t be true. It had to be a dream. But it wasn¡¯t, because there she was again.

¡®Just a few more words and then it really will be goodnight, dear Romeo. If you really mean it, and you want to marry me, send me a message tomorrow. I¡¯ll send someone to you. Let me know where and for what time you¡¯ve arranged a wedding and I¡¯ll come to you. Then we¡¯ll be together forever.¡¯

¡®Juliet!¡¯ Her nurse was shouting now.

¡®Coming!¡¯ called Juliet. ¡®But if you don¡¯t mean it, I beg of you¡¦¡¯

¡®Juliet!¡¯

¡®I¡¯m coming!¡¯ She leant right over and reached out towards Romeo. ¡®If you¡¯re trifling with me please leave me alone to deal with my grief. I¡¯ll send a messenger tomorrow.¡¯

Romeo felt he was being left behind. She thought he may not mean it! ¡®As true as -¡®  he began but she had gone. And he was left alone. He felt as though a light had gone out. He had better get out of there. He turned but then he heard her again.

¡®Psst! Romeo! Pssst!¡¯

He was beneath her balcony like an arrow.

¡®Romeo. What time shall I send someone?¡¯

¡®At nine.¡¯

¡®I¡¯ll make sure of that. It¡¯ll feel like twenty years till then.¡¯ She laughed. ¡®I¡¯ve forgotten why I called you back.¡¯

¡®That¡¯s alright. I¡¯ll just stand here until you remember it.¡¯

¡®Then I¡¯ll never remember it, so that you¡¯ll stand there forever.¡¯

¡®And I¡¯ll keep standing here, hoping you¡¯ll keep forgetting. And I¡¯ll forget that I¡¯ve got any other home but this.¡¯

¡®It¡¯s almost morning,¡¯ she said. ¡®I want you to go but I don¡¯t want to let go of you.

You must leave now. It¡¯s so hard to say goodbye. I¡¯d like to keep saying ¡°goodnight¡± until it becomes tomorrow.¡¯ With a last lingering look she broke away from his gaze and was gone.

Romeo ran through the orchard and scaled the wall without being aware of its height. The sun was about to come up. There would be no sleep for him. He would go straight to Friar Lawrence¡¯s chapel, tell him the wonderful thing that had happened to him and get his help."
"Act 2, Scene 3","Friar Lawrence was up early. The clouds in the eastern sky were streaked with light as the night scurried out of the way of the advancing day. He looked up from time to time. He wanted to fill his basket with a mixture of poisonous and healing herbs before the sun came up to dry the dew.

He loved nature. He often thought about the soil ? about the way that it encompassed the whole of life. It was a grave that took all life into itself when it died but it was also a mother, from which all new life sprang.

Plants fascinated him. He felt that every single plant had great value: even those we think are vile have some power and grace. Every living thing was special although nothing was so good that it couldn¡¯t be dangerous if it was abused.

He held a young plant up and stared at it in wonder. Even this little flower had both poisonous and healing qualities. If you smelt it it would heal your ailments: if you swallowed it you would die. People were like that too ? they had both good and evil in them.

A youth was coming towards him through the tall grass. ¡®Morning, Father,¡¯ he called.

¡®Ah,¡¯ said the Friar as Romeo reached him, panting. ¡®Who¡¯s this then, visiting me so early in the morning? Is there something wrong, my boy, being up so early? You must be worried about something or you¡¯d be in your bed, fast asleep. We old men know what it¡¯s like to lie awake all night, worrying, but you youngsters can sleep soundly at any time. So to see you here so early makes me think you¡¯ve got something on your mind. In any case, I can tell that you¡¯ve not even been to bed tonight.¡¯

¡®You¡¯re right there,¡¯ said Romeo. ¡®I had a better rest.¡¯

¡®God pardon you,¡¯ said Friar Lawrence. ¡®Have you been with Rosaline?¡¯

¡®Rosaline?¡¯ Romeo¡¯s brow furrowed. ¡®No. I¡¯ve forgotten that name and everything about her.¡¯

¡®That¡¯s my boy,¡¯ said the Friar. ¡®But where have you been then?¡¯

¡®Come on, Father. I¡¯ll tell you all about it on the way to your chapel.¡¯ Romeo couldn¡¯t keep the excitement out of his voice as they walked.

¡®I was feasting with my enemies when suddenly one of them wounded me. In fact I inflicted a wound too. But you¡¯re the one who can heal us both.¡¯

¡®Speak plainly,¡¯ said the Friar. ¡®I don¡¯t understand what you¡¯re getting at.¡¯

¡®To put it plainly, I¡¯ve fallen in love with Capulet¡¯s daughter, and she with me. And to cut a long story short, you must marry us, and you must agree to marry us today.¡¯

The Friar had stopped. ¡®Holy St. Francis¡¯ ¡® he exclaimed. ¡®What a turnabout. Have you forgotten Rosaline? Am I to understand that young men love with their eyes and not their hearts? Jesu Maria. You cried buckets for Rosaline. The sound of your groans is still ringing in my ears. Look. Here on your cheek, there¡¯s the stain of a tear. It was Rosaline this and Rosaline that yesterday and now it¡¯s all changed.¡¯

¡®You told me off all the time for loving Rosaline.¡¯

¡®For being infatuated, not loving, my boy.¡¯

¡®And told me to bury love.

¡®Not to dig another one up.¡¯

¡®Please,¡¯ said Romeo. ¡®Don¡¯t reprimand me. The one I love now loves me in return. The other didn¡¯t.¡¯

¡®Because she could see you didn¡¯t mean it.¡¯ Friar Lawrence was thinking. Marrying the two young people from the feuding families would be a disaster and he couldn¡¯t possible agree to it. Or could he? It may be the best way of bringing the families together. It could just be the salvation of Verona. It took him a second to decide. ¡®Come on then, you young rascal,¡¯ he said. ¡®Come with me. This is one thing I can help you with. This could be the answer: the thing to turn your households¡¯ hatred into love.¡¯

¡®Well let¡¯s hurry then,¡¯ said Romeo. ¡®I can¡¯t wait.¡¯

¡®Slow down,¡¯ said the Friar as Romeo started running. ¡®You¡¯ll stumble if you try to go too fast.¡¯"
"Act 2, Scene 4","¡®Where the devil could Romeo be?¡¯

Mercutio and Benvolio sat in the shade of the fountain¡¯s wall. It was going to be another hot day. Mercutio drew a heart in the dust. ¡®Didn¡¯t he come home last night?¡¯

¡®Not to his father¡¯s.¡¯ said Benvolio. ¡®I talked to his servant.¡¯

¡®Who would have thought it?¡¯ said Mercutio. ¡®That the dull cold Rosaline should have the power to drive him crazy.¡¯

¡®Did you know that Capulet¡¯s nephew¡¯s sent a letter to his father¡¯s house?¡¯ said Benvolio.

¡®No. A challenge!¡¯

¡®Romeo will answer it.¡¯

¡®Any man who can write could answer a letter,¡¯ said Mercutio.

¡®No, I mean he¡¯ll accept the challenge.¡¯

¡®It¡¯ll be a walkover. Romeo¡¯s already dead,¡¯ said Mercutio. ¡®Stabbed with a woman¡¯s eye, run through with a love song, his heart pierced by Cupid¡¯s arrow. And you think he¡¯s fit to take Tybalt on?¡¯

¡®What¡¯s so special about Tybalt?¡¯ said Benvolio.

¡®Didn¡¯t you know?¡¯ said Mercutio ¡®He¡¯s more than just the Prince of Cats. He¡¯s a champ. He¡¯s as good at fighting as you are at singing. His timing is perfect ? when he counts bars it¡¯s one, two -¡¯ Mercutio mimed a swordsman in action. ¡®And the third one is in your chest.¡¯ Jabbing at Benvolio with his finger. ¡®He can hit a silk button at his first go.He¡¯s a swordsman, our Tybalt. He¡¯s in the first league, an expert in all the strokes. He¡¯s a¡¦¡¯ Mercutio shook his head.

¡®A what?¡¯

¡®Forget it,¡¯ said Mercutio. ¡®He¡¯s a poser plain and simple.¡¯

¡®Hey,¡¯ said Benvolio as Romeo came towards them. ¡®Here he is, the man himself.¡¯

¡®Ah,¡¯ said Mercutio. ¡®Look at him. What a lad.¡¯ The most beautiful women in history were kitchen girls to his Rosaline. Even Dido was a peasant.¡¯ He bowed. ¡®Signor Romeo, bon jour. How¡¯s that for a nice French greeting? You cheated us well and truly last night.¡¯

¡®Good morning,¡¯ said Romeo. ¡®What do you mean?¡¯

¡®The slip, the slip,¡¯ said Mercutio. ¡®Don¡¯t you understand? You gave us the slip.¡¯

¡®I¡¯m sorry Mercutio. I had important business. I¡¯m sorry.¡¯

They began ribbing each other, exchanging insults. Romeo¡¯s friends were pleased to see that he was back to his normal self.

¡®There we are,¡¯ said Mercutio. ¡®Isn¡¯t this better than groaning for love? Now you¡¯re sociable ? you¡¯re Romeo again, the Romeo we all know.¡¯

Romeo was unable to take the big grin off his face. He kept looking up and down the square: whenever he saw any new movement he looked up.

And there it was at last ? Juliet ¡®s nurse all dressed up in full skirts and a billowing train which the hapless Peter was trying to hold down as she swept across the piazza.

¡®A sail, a sail!¡¯ shouted Romeo, and his friends joined him as he ran to greet the Nurse.

Mercutio grabbed the train from Peter and flapped it up and down. The Nurse turned and gave him a backhand which sent him flying into the dust.

¡®Peter,¡¯ she said.

¡®Here,¡¯ said her companion. ¡®Give me my fan, Peter.¡¯

¡®Good Peter,¡¯ said Mercutio, picking himself up and rubbing his jaw. ¡®Give her her fan, good Peter,¡¯ He put on a high voice, imitating the Nurse. ¡®She needs it to hide her face. The fan is the prettier.¡¯

The Nurse took a swing at him again and he ducked. More youngsters had gathered and they cheered. Mercutio took a bow and they cheered again.

¡®Good morning, gentlemen,¡¯ said the Nurse.

¡®Good afternoon, fair gentlewoman, ¡® said Mercutio, sweeping his cap off.

¡®Is it afternoon?¡¯ she said.

¡®Oh yes,¡¯ said Mercutio. ¡®The rude hand of the dial is now right on the prick of noon.¡¯

¡®Disgusting¡¯ she said. ¡®You disgusting man¡¯

When they had all stopped laughing the Nurse sat down on the fountain wall and fanned herself. ¡®Gentlemen,¡¯ she said. ¡®Can any of you tell me where I can find young Romeo?¡¯

They all looked at Romeo.

¡®I can tell you,¡¯ said Romeo. ¡®But young Romeo will be older by the time you¡¯ve found him, than he was when you began looking for him. Yes it¡¯s me. I¡¯m the youngest of that name. For better or worse.¡¯

¡®Well said.¡¯ The Nurse grinned.

¡®That was well said?¡¯ said Mercutio. ¡®You¡¯re not hard to please, are you?¡¯

The Nurse waved him away and he threw himself on to the ground, lifted her skirt an inch and peeked under it and receiving another well aimed slap for that.

¡®If you are he, I¡¯d like a word with you,¡¯ she told Romeo. She winced and blew on her stinging hand.

¡®I think she¡¯s going to proposition him,¡¯ said Benvolio.

¡®A whore, a whore!¡¯ cried Mercutio, ¡®Tally ho!¡¯

The young men came closer and began walking round her.

¡®What¡¯s the message?¡¯ said Romeo. ¡®Go on,¡¯ he told his friends. ¡®Leave us alone,¡¯

¡®When you¡¯ve finished with her come to your house,¡¯ said Mercutio, bored with the game. ¡®We¡¯re all invited to dinner.¡¯

¡®I¡¯ll be there,¡¯ said Romeo.

¡®Farewell, old girl,¡¯ sang Mercutio, walking backwards, bowing. ¡®Lady, lady, lady.¡¯

¡®Who¡¯s the cheeky one?¡¯ said the Nurse when they had gone. ¡®All those tricks!¡¯

¡®Oh, he¡¯s just a fellow who loves the sound of his own voice,¡¯ said Romeo,

¡®If he does that again I¡¯ll sort him out,¡¯ she said. ¡®I could deal with twenty like him. Tell him if I can¡¯t I can find someone who will! I¡¯m not the things he called me.¡¯ She turned to where Peter was sitting by the fountain, trailing his hand in the water. ¡®And you can stand by and allow everyone to abuse me?¡¯

Peter was up immediately. ¡®I didn¡¯t see anyone abuse you,¡¯ he said. ¡®And if I had I would have protected you. I¡¯m always ready for a good fight. As long as it¡¯s legal.¡¯

¡®Now as God is my witness I¡¯m so upset I¡¯m still trembling,¡¯ she said. ¡®Awful fellow.¡¯ She breathed deeply. ¡®Ah now.¡¯ She looked at Romeo. ¡®As I said, I want a word with you. My young lady told me to find you. What she told me to say I¡¯ll keep to myself for the time being. But first let me tell you: if you¡¯re leading her into a fool¡¯s paradise, as they say, it would be the most wicked behaviour, as they say, for the poor girl is very young and therefore if you¡¯re planning to double cross her then it¡¯s a despicable thing to do to any young woman.¡¯ She folded her arms and looked defiantly at him.

¡®Nurse,¡¯ he said. ¡®Give your young lady my compliments. I promise you¡¦¡¯

¡®Oh!¡¯ she said. ¡®I¡¯ll tell her that. Lord, Lord, she¡¯ll be so happy!¡¯

¡®Tell her what?¡¯ said Romeo. ¡®You¡¯re not listening.¡¯

¡®I¡¯ll tell her that you promise, which is such a good start.¡¯

¡®Tell her to find some way of going to confession this afternoon and there at Friar Lawrence¡¯s chapel she¡¯ll be given absolution and married, all at the same time. Here.¡¯

He pulled a little bag out of his pocket.

¡®No,¡¯ she said as she took the money and hid it in her clothing. ¡®Not a penny. This afternoon, you say? Well she¡¯ll be there.¡¯

¡®Wait Nurse,¡¯ he said as she turned, full of excitement. ¡®My servant will bring you a rope ladder so that I¡¯ll be able to get to Juliet¡¯s room tonight. Goodbye. If you¡¯re loyal to us I¡¯ll pay you well. Goodbye. Give your mistress my love.¡¯

¡®Bless you, bless you, Sir,¡¯ she said. ¡®Oh, listen.¡¯

¡®What?¡¯

¡®Can you trust your servant?¡¯

¡®Oh yes,¡¯ said Romeo. ¡®He¡¯s as true as steel.¡¯

¡®Oh Sir, my mistress is the sweetest thing. Lord, Lord, when she was a little chattering thing¡¦ Hmm.¡¯ Oh, I must tell you ? there is a nobleman in town ? a fellow named Paris ? who has designs on her. But I can tell you she would rather marry a toad ? a very toad ? than him. I annoyed her by telling her Paris is better than you. I was only teasing but she grew as pale as a sheet. Don¡¯t rosemary and Romeo begin with the same letter?¡¯

Romeo sighed. ¡®Yes nurse but so what? Both with an R?¡¯

¡®R. It sounds like a dog growling. R is for ? No, it¡¯s some other letter, But my lady has the cutest saying about you and rosemary You¡¯d love it. I think ¡¦¡¯

¡®Give her my love, Nurse.¡¯

¡®Of course. With pleasure.¡¯ She was all smiles. ¡®Peter!¡¯

¡®Coming!¡¯

¡®Go in front of me. And hurry!¡¯"
"Act 2, Scene 5","Juliet could see by the way the sun hung over the distant hill that it was twelve o¡¯clock. Her Nurse had been gone three hours! She had promised to return in half an hour.

Perhaps she hadn¡¯t found him! No, that couldn¡¯t be. Oh, Nurse. was pathetic. The messengers of love should be as light as thoughts, traveling ten times faster than sunbeams, pushing all doubts and fears away, as light does to threatening shadows.

That¡¯s why Love¡¯s coach is always drawn by swiftly flying doves: that¡¯s why Cupid has wings!

If her Nurse had any feelings ? any passion whatsoever ? her message would travel as fast as a tennis ball. The Nurse would be the ball. Juliet would serve and Romeo would return it just as fast. But like all old people, the Nurse might as well be dead. She was clumsy, slow, heavy and dull, like lead.
Juliet stuck her head out of the window every few seconds, searching the alleyway along which the Nurse would come.

And at last, there she was!

Juliet flew downstairs and into the garden, meeting the Nurse as a servant was opening the gate for her. She flung herself at her old friend.

¡®Oh honey Nurse! What did he say? Did you find him? Send your servant away.¡¯

¡®Peter,¡¯ said the Nurse. ¡®Stay here at the gate.¡¯

¡®Now, dear sweet Nurse,¡¯ said Juliet as they got out of earshot of the men at the gate. She turned and stood right in front of the Nurse. ¡®Oh Lord! why are you looking so sad? Even if it¡¯s bad news, tell it with a smile. Please Nurse? Or if it¡¯s good don¡¯t spoil the music of good news with such a sour face!¡¯
They were passing a shady bower with a garden bench. ¡®Whew, I ¡®m exhausted,¡¯
said the Nurse. ¡®Leave me alone for a while.¡¯ She sank down on to the bench. ¡®Oh, my legs ache. Such a tiring journey.¡¯

Juliet wanted to scream with impatience. ¡®You can have my legs if you would just give me your news! Please, Nurse, I beg of you, tell me. Please, dear, dear Nurse, tell me!¡¯

¡®Jesus,¡¯ said the Nurse, leaning back, panting. ¡®What a hurry you¡¯re in! Can¡¯t you wait a minute. Can¡¯t you see I¡¯m out of breath?¡¯

¡®How can you be out of breath when you¡¯ve got enough breath to tell me you¡¯re out of breath? Your excuse for not telling me is longer than the simple yes or no which is all I want.¡¯

Juliet knelt on the grass in front of the Nurse. ¡®Is it good or is it bad?¡¯

The Nurse shook her head sadly. ¡®Well, all I can say is that you¡¯ve made a bad choice. You¡¯ve no idea how to choose a man. Romeo! No, not him, he¡¯s not the one.¡¯

Juliet drew back, giving the Nurse a look of incredulity. But the Nurse hadn¡¯t even paused to draw breath. ¡®Although he¡¯s more handsome than any other man. And he¡¯s got better legs. And as for the rest of him, his hands and feet, and the whole of his body, for that matter¡¦¡¯ She leant forward and whispered ¡®¡¦although we mustn¡¯t talk about those things ? they are beyond compare.¡¯

Juliet didn¡¯t know whether to laugh or to cry with frustration as the Nurse went on.

¡®He¡¯s not the absolute flower of good manners, of course, but I¡¯ll bet he¡¯s as gentle as a lamb.¡¯ Prodding Juliet playfully in the ribs.

She got up, suddenly and yawned. ¡®Off with you now, girl. Get on with it. Have you had your dinner?¡¯

¡®No,¡¯ said Juliet. ¡®But I knew all those things about Romeo before. What did he say about us getting married? What about that?¡¯

The Nurse slid back on to the bench and lay, reclining. ¡®Lord, what a headache I¡¯ve got. It¡¯s pounding so hard that it feels as though it¡¯s going to break into twenty pieces.¡¯

She tried to stand up. ¡®Oh, my back. Shame on you, sending me all over the place like that. It¡¯ll be the death of me.¡¯

¡®Honestly,¡¯ said Juliet, ready to burst. ¡®I¡¯m very sorry you¡¯re not well. Sweet, sweet, sweet Nurse. What did my love say?¡¯

The Nurse heaved a huge sigh. ¡®Your love says, like an honest man, and a courteous, and a kind and a handsome, and, I have no doubt, a good -¡¯ She stopped suddenly and looked towards the house. ¡®Where¡¯s your mother?¡¯

¡®Where is my mother?¡¯ Juliet threw up her hands. ¡®In there, of course. Where do you think she is? What a strange answer. ¡°Your love says, like an honest man, where is your mother?¡±¡¯

¡®Good God, my dear young woman,¡¯ said the Nurse. Bad tempered with me? Is this the thanks I get for my aching bones? Do your own dirty work from now on.¡¯

¡®This is impossible,¡¯ groaned Juliet. ¡®Come on, what did Romeo say?¡¯

The Nurse stopped rubbing her back and took Juliet¡¯s hands. ¡®Have you got permission to go to confession today?¡¯

¡®I have.¡¯

¡®Then get yourself to Friar Lawrence¡¯s cell as fast as you can. There¡¯s a husband waiting there to make you a wife. Hurry. I have one more thing to do. I have to get a rope ladder so that your lover can climb up to your love nest as soon as it¡¯s dark.¡¯ She turned. ¡®Off with you. I¡¯m going to have my dinner. Go on Hurry.¡¯"
"Act 2, Scene 6","It was cool in the chapel. Romeo watched heat waves rising above the wild flowers which grew unhindered across the hillside.

¡®May Heaven bless this holy ceremony so that we won¡¯t regret it later!¡¯ Friar Lawrence was saying.

¡®Yes, yes,¡¯ said Romeo. He didn¡¯t take his eyes off the door. ¡®But whatever sorrow may come it couldn¡¯t cancel the joy I get from seeing her for even a moment. You just join our hands with holy words and after that it doesn¡¯t matter what happens: it¡¯s enough that she¡¯ll be my wife.¡¯

Friar Lawrence tutted. ¡®Such extreme emotions often end in disaster ? they explode like gunpowder. Be careful, my boy. Even honey can become sickly precisely because it¡¯s so sweet, and eventually you can¡¯t face it. So don¡¯t go overboard on this loving of yours. It will last longer if you take it easy. If you go too fast you¡¯ll fall.¡¯

But Romeo wasn¡¯t listening. He had been watching the brow of the hill and when Juliet¡¯s head appeared he sprang up and rushed to the door while the Friar was still talking.

She came, running so lightly that it was as though she wasn¡¯t touching the ground.

By the time she got to within ten yards of the chapel she was in her lover¡¯s arms. They clung to each other and he kissed her again and again. Friar Lawrence prized them apart gently.

¡®Dear Juliet,¡¯ said Romeo. ¡®If you are as happy as I am and can express it better, then tell me how much happiness you imagine we have when we add it all up.¡¯

¡®As usual, you say ridiculous things,¡¯ she said. ¡®You speak extravagantly. And don¡¯t talk about imagined love. Our love is real. And people who can count their wealth are poor: my true love has grown so huge that I couldn¡¯t measure half of it.¡¯

¡®Come on, come on,¡¯ said Friar Lawrence. ¡®Enough of this nonsense. Let¡¯s get on with it. Follow me.¡¯"
"Act 3, Scene 1","It was hot: the only movement came from a lizard that broke cover and streaked through the white dust of the piazza to the safety of an ivy covered wall. The goats and chickens and piglets were silent and the market traders dozed beneath their awnings.

Dinner ended at the Montague house. Benvolio and Mercutio and the friends who had been with them left their hosts to their siesta and sauntered through the scorching piazza. When they reached the fountain Mercutio bent over towards it and splashed water at the others.

¡®Come on now, Mercutio¡¯ said Benvolio. ¡®Let¡¯s go. It¡¯s very hot and we¡¯re right outside Capulet ¡®s house: if we should bump into any of them there¡¯s bound to be trouble. Tempers are short in this heat.¡¯

Mercutio laughed. ¡®Look who¡¯s talking. You¡¯re the biggest troublemaker of all.

You¡¯re like the fellow who goes into a pub, slams his sword down on the counter and cries: ¡°I hope I won¡¯t need you¡± and then, after his second drink, challenges the landlord for no reason at all.¡¯

¡®Who, me?¡¯ said Benvolio. They were all pointing at him and laughing.

¡®Come on now, what¡¯s this innocent act?¡¯ said Mercutio, ¡®You¡¯re as hot a fellow as any in Italy.¡¯ He winked at the others who demonstrated their agreement by thumping Benvolio on the back, jeering, pretending to protect themselves from him and generally fooling about, ¡®You¡¯re as quickly aroused as anyone.¡¯

¡®Aroused to what?¡¯ said Benvolio, sitting down and scooping water over himself.

¡®What?¡¯ said Mercutio. ¡®If there were two like you there would soon be none: you¡¯d kill each other. You? You¡¯d quarrel with a man who had one hair more or less than you in his beard.¡¯ Encouraged by the laughter, including Benvolio¡¯s now, he continued. ¡®You¡¯d quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason than that you¡¯ve got hazel eyes. Your head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of yolk ? in fact your brains have been scrambled by the number of times you¡¯ve had your head punched.¡¯

Mercutio was precariously balanced on the fountain wall and Benvolio seized the moment and pushed him. Mercutio landed in the water with a great splash. He lay at the bottom, holding his breath. His friends grew silent, then just as they were beginning to be worried his head popped up.

¡®You have quarreled with a man who coughed and woke your dog, sleeping in the sun,¡¯ he continued when the cheering had subsided. He climbed out and sat on the wall again. ¡®Didn¡¯t you once fall out with a tailor for wearing his new waistcoat before Easter?

And someone else for tying his new shoes with old laces? And you lecture me on quarrels?¡¯

¡®Huh!¡¯ said Benvolio. ¡®If I were as quick to quarrel as you no-one on earth would bet on my life lasting longer than an hour and a quarter.¡¯

¡®Oh what¡¦¡¯ began Mercutio but Benvolio interrupted him. He had just seen a group of young men coming out of the Capulet mansion. ¡®Careful,¡¯ he said. ¡®Here come the Capulets.¡¯

Mercutio didn¡¯t even turn round. He carried on pouring water over his head. ¡®So what?¡¯ he said.

There were about a dozen of them. They strode purposefully towards Benvolio and his friends. Their leader was easily recognizable by his swagger and general air of self assurance. It was Tybalt. Mercutio began whistling.

¡®Stay close behind me,¡¯ Tybalt told his companions. ¡®I¡¯ll do the talking. Gentlemen, good afternoon. I¡¯d like a word with one of you.¡¯

¡®Is that all?¡¯ said Mercutio. ¡®Just one word with just one of us? ¡¯ He resumed his whistling and pretended to wash his armpits. ¡®Let¡¯s have a bit more than just one word. Add something to it: make it a word and a blow.¡¯

¡®You¡¯ll find me ready for that, Sir, if you give me any reason,¡¯ said Tybalt. His voice was cold and controlled.

¡®Couldn¡¯t you find some reason?¡¯ said Mercutio. He began polishing the fountain head ? spitting, polishing, spitting again, and rubbing at one spot with great concentration.

The others relaxed, seeing that Mercutio was determined to turn it into a joke, and they laughed. He looked so funny that the Capulets joined in. Tybalt¡¯s face was grim, though. He took a few steps forward until he was standing just a yard from Mercutio, who was still polishing.

¡®Mercutio, you consort with Romeo,¡¯ he said.

¡®Consort?¡¯ Mercutio stopped his cleaning and looked round at Tybalt for the first time. ¡®What, are you making musicians of us?¡¯ He stood up: he jumped down so that he was standing on the dry earth of the piazza. ¡®If you make musicians of us don¡¯t expect anything but discords.¡¯ He drew his sword. ¡®Here¡¯s my fiddle bow. Here¡¯s the thing that will make you dance. God almighty! Consorts!¡¯

He had taken Tybalt by surprise. Tybalt stepped back and stood for a moment, undecided.

Benvolio had a terrible feeling that in spite of Mercutio¡¯s clowning it could develop into something nasty. ¡®Look here,¡¯ he said. ¡®This is a public place. Either discuss it rationally or let¡¯s go somewhere private. Or better still, let¡¯s just go home. Everyone¡¯s looking at us.¡¯

Tybalt planted himself squarely and drew his sword. ¡®Men¡¯s eyes were made for looking,¡¯ he said. ¡®I won¡¯t budge for anyone.¡¯

Mercutio looked as though he was going to make an opening move but instead of engaging with Tybalt he lowered the point of his rapier and buried it in the ground. Then he leant on it and began whistling again. Everyone clapped. Even Tybalt smiled. It might have ended there if Romeo hadn¡¯t come running towards them, shouting ? ¡®Benvolio! Mercutio!¡¯

¡®Well never mind,¡¯ said Tybalt. ¡®Here comes my man.¡¯

¡®I don¡¯t see him wearing your uniform,¡¯ said Mercutio. ¡®If you think he¡¯s your man then you¡¯ll find out how right you are. Lead on to the dueling field and you¡¯ll discover that he¡¯s your man alright.¡¯

Romeo was out of breath when he reached them. He leant over the fountain and drank deeply.

¡®Romeo,¡¯ said Tybalt.

Romeo turned and smiled. Hi s face was dripping water.

¡®There¡¯s only one thing I have to say to you.¡¯ Tybalt drew himself up. ¡®You are a scoundrel.¡¯ He hadn¡¯t put his rapier away and he raised it now in a challenge, even though Romeo wasn¡¯t wearing a sword.

¡®Tybalt! ¡® said Romeo. ¡®I have good reasons for excusing this behaviour of yours. But don¡¯t call me a scoundrel. I¡¯ll say goodbye now. It ¡®s best to ignore you if you ¡®re going to be like this.¡¯ He turned back to the fountain to the accompaniment of applause from his friends and catcalls from Tybalt¡¯s followers.

¡®Boy,¡¯ said Tybalt, and they all went quiet again. ¡®This won¡¯t excuse your insult to me. So turn and draw,¡¯
Romeo turned and put his hand out. ¡®Come on now,¡¯ he said. ¡®I¡¯ve never insulted you: I love you more than you can imagine.¡¯

There was applause again. But Mercutio, who had been nodding his approval until now, stopped smiling as he watched Tybalt ignore Romeo¡¯s extended hand. He looked from the one to the other.

¡®You¡¯ll know the reason for my love very soon,¡¯ continued Romeo. ¡®And so, dear Capulet, whose name I respect as highly as my own, be patient till then.¡¯

There was nothing Tybalt could do: if Romeo refused to take up his challenge there was nothing for it but to leave. He turned to go. Mercutio sprang up. ¡®How can you let him push you around like that?¡¯ he said. ¡®Submit to him if you like but I won¡¯t. Hey Tybalt, you rat-catcher!¡¯ You¡¯re not leaving! are you?¡¯

Tybalt turned. ¡®Why? What do you want?¡¯

Mercutio drew his rapier. ¡®My dear king of cats,¡¯ he said, ¡®Only one of your nine lives. I intend taking it from you and, depending on how you behave after that, beat the other eight with a stick.¡¯ He bowed. ¡®Will you be so kind as to draw your sword out of its scabbard by its ears? Hurry, if you please, or mine will be around your ears before you know it.¡¯

Tybalt smiled. ¡®Well Sir.¡¯ He drew his sword, ¡®I am for you.¡¯

¡®No,¡¯ said Romeo as the two faced each other, their swords poised. ¡®Please, please, Mercutio. Put your rapier away.¡¯

Mercutio took up an exaggerated en garde position, which made his friends laugh. He was being absurd, as usual, but no-one was worried because they all knew that he was one of the best swordsmen in Verona. Romeo was the only one whose face showed concern.

¡®Come Sir,¡¯ said Mercutio. ¡®Your passado.¡¯ Tybalt soon realized that he wasn¡¯t going to get anywhere with Mercutio, who was using this opportunity to demonstrate his clowning abilities rather than his fencing skills. The supporters on both sides hooted at his antics. Even Tybalt laughed when his opponent backed up to the fountain, fell in the water and emerged again, spraying them all with a jet from his mouth. Only Romeo couldn¡¯t laugh. He seemed unusually upset. ¡®Help me, Benvolio,¡¯ he said. ¡®Draw, Benvolio. Beat down their weapons.¡¯

But Benvolio was enjoying the show: he was weak with laughter. Romeo ran in front of Mercutio. ¡®Mercutio! Stop it.¡¯ Then Tybalt. ¡®Please stop.¡¯ Then pushing Mercutio out of Tybalt¡¯s way. ¡®Stop. The Prince has forbidden this in Verona. Don¡¯t you remember? Oh please, stop, both of you.¡¯

A crowd had gathered and they were all laughing. Then suddenly, for no apparent reason, Tybalt froze. He stared at Mercutio for a few moments then turned and, followed by a handful of his closest friends, began walking away swiftly. Romeo¡¯s relief was so great that he jumped at Mercutio and embraced him.

Mercutio clung to him. He had an agonized expression on his face. ¡®I¡¯m hurt.¡¯ he said. ¡®Curse both your houses.¡¯ He clutched his side and grimaced round at the crowd. They roared. He broke away from Romeo and tottered towards the laughing faces. ¡®I¡¯ve had it.¡¯ he told them and they laughed even louder. He swayed, his legs buckled and he fell.

Benvolio wiped a tear and, trying to bring his laughter under control, knelt beside his friend, ¡®What? are you hurt?¡¯ He grinned round at the crowd and they cheered.

¡®Just a scratch,¡¯ said Mercutio. ¡®But it¡¯s enough.¡¯ More cheering. ¡®Where¡¯s my page?¡¯ said Mercutio. ¡®Tell him to go and get a doctor.¡¯

Romeo noticed a small blood stain on Mercutio¡¯s shirt, but it couldn¡¯t be serious because of the way his friend was clowning. ¡®Come on, Mercutio,¡¯ he said, ¡®The wound can¡¯t be that bad?¡¯

¡®No,¡¯ said Mercutio. ¡®It¡¯s not as deep as a well, nor as wide as a church door. But it¡¯s enough: it will do.¡¯ The crowd was clapping. Mercutio raised himself on to his elbow and saluted them. ¡®Ask for me tomorrow,¡¯ he said, ¡®and you will find me a grave man.¡¯ They fell about. Mercutio dropped back on to the ground.

Romeo knelt down and Mercutio gripped his hand, ¡®I¡¯ve had it!¡¯ He was gasping. ¡®Romeo,¡¯ he said. ¡®Curse both your houses. God, to be killed by a dog! A rat ? a mouse ? a cat¡¦ An arrogant poser like that. Why did you keep coming between us? He got me under your arm.¡¯

¡®I was only trying to help,¡¯ said Romeo. Mercutio must be exaggerating. It couldn¡¯t be that bad?

¡®Benvolio,¡¯ said Mercutio. His voice was scarcely more than a whisper. ¡®Help me into the house or I¡¯ll pass out.¡¯

Romeo and Benvolio lifted him. Benvolio slung Mercutio¡¯s arm over his shoulder and the two began walking to the Montague mansion. Mercutio kept falling down and getting up again. The onlookers applauded. Romeo went and sat on the fountain wall. He didn¡¯t join in with the banter. He wasn¡¯t sure what to think. Mercutio¡¯s words were bitter, but then he always spoke in that way. It was a comical sight, Mercutio leaning on Benvolio and putting on a funny walk.

When they had gone some way Mercutio turned. ¡®Both your houses!¡¯ he shouted then slumped against Benvolio. ¡®They¡¯ve made worm¡¯s meat of me,¡¯ he whispered. ¡®I¡¯ve had it. Curse your houses.¡¯

Benvolio helped him into the house, Romeo found himself alone as the others moved away, all the fun being over. He was sure Mercutio wasn¡¯t badly hurt but he couldn¡¯t dispel the thought that even if it wasn¡¯t too bad it was his fault. Mercutio, his friend, close relative of the Prince, had got this wound on his behalf. The more he thought about it the more miserable he became.

He thought about the insults Tybalt had launched at him ? Tybalt who was his cousin now. He should have answered his challenge: he had been taken off guard by Juliet ¡®s beauty and gone soft ? turned into a coward.
Benvolio was running towards him.

¡®Oh Romeo,¡¯ he said as he came near, ¡®Mercutio¡¯s dead¡¯.¡¯

Romeo felt the shock as though someone had hit him. It wasn¡¯t true. It couldn¡¯t be. He hadn¡¯t been pretending. The wound had been worse than any of them had thought.

¡®There¡¯s going to be more of this,¡¯ he said. ¡®I can feel it. This is only the beginning,¡¯

¡®There¡¯s Tybalt again,¡¯ said Benvolio as Tybalt came out of the Capulet house. Romeo was up in a second. He pulled Benvolio¡¯s sword out of its scabbard and dashed across the piazza.

¡®Tybalt,¡¯ he yelled. ¡®You called me a scoundrel. Take it back! Mercutio¡¯s dead and one of us will go with him.¡¯

Tybalt stopped. His face was grim. ¡®You wretched boy,¡¯ he said. ¡®You¡¯ll be the one to go with him.¡¯
Romeo waved the sword. ¡®This will decide that,¡¯ he said.

The fight was bitter and furious. There was no room for posturing, no time for niceties: it was a fight to the death. Both lost their rapiers during the exchange and it turned into a test of physical strength as they punched and scratched and kicked each other. Romeo came close to suffocation at one point as Tybalt got him round the neck and tried to squeeze the life out of him. But he struggled out of it and backed away. Then their friends rearmed them.

The piazza was crowded now, as what seemed like the whole of Verona watched. All the earlier humour and laughter had gone. This was a serious fight and even Benvolio didn¡¯t try to stop it. Romeo was exhausted but he summoned up all his stamina and as soon as he saw his chance he took it ? his rapier pierced Tybalt through the chest. He felt the weapon give as it passed through Tvbalt¡¯s body and he saw Tybalt¡¯s shirt begin to turn red. Then time seemed to stop: it was as though nothing moved. He pulled his rapier out and Tybalt fell. The fiery Capulet was dead before he touched the ground. Benvolio couldn¡¯t take it all in. All he could think was, thank God it was Tybalt rather than Romeo, as he stared at the young Capulet, lying on his back, his eyes still open.

¡®Run, Romeo!¡¯ he shouted, ¡®Don¡¯t stand staring. It¡¯s death if they catch you. Get going!¡¯

¡®Oh, fate has destroyed me,¡¯ said Romeo.

¡®What are you waiting for?¡¯ said Benvolio, There was only one place Romeo could go. He took a last look around and fled. A group of guards approached Benvolio.

¡®Where¡¯s the man who killed Mercutio?¡¯ one of them demanded. ¡®Which way did Tybalt go?¡¯

¡®There he is,¡¯ said Benvolio, pointing to the body.

¡®Come with me,¡¯ said the guard, as a trumpet fanfare sounded across the piazza.

¡®I arrest you in the name of the Prince.¡¯

Word of Mercutio¡¯s death had spread fast. As the Prince strode into the piazza Montague¡¯s men were bringing Mercutio¡¯s body out. Montague and his wife accompanied them. The Capulets came out of their house too, and the four stood and faced the Prince as they had done only the day before. The guards lifted Tybalt¡¯s body and lay it beside Mercutio¡¯s.

¡®Where are those who started this quarrel?¡¯ said the Prince.

Benvolio sank to his knees. ¡®Noble Prince, I can tell you everything. He pointed to Tybalt¡¯s body. ¡®There he is, killed by young Romeo for killing your cousin Mercutio.¡¯

Lady Capulet fell down in the dust and kissed Tybalt¡¯s face. ¡®Oh my brother¡¯s child!¡¯ she wailed She looked from the Prince to her husband. ¡®Oh Prince, the blood of my nephew has been spilt. I want revenge. I want the Montague¡¯s blood. She lay her head on Tybalt¡¯s chest. ¡®Oh nephew, nephew,¡¯ she sobbed.

The Prince¡¯s main emotion was anger. ¡®Benvolio!¡¯ he said. ¡®Who started this?¡¯

Benvolio told the Prince how gently Romeo had spoken to Tybalt, had said he hadn¡¯t wanted to fight, mentioned the anger the Prince would feel. And then, how Tybalt had turned on Mercutio who, just as angry, started quarreling until it came to blows. He told the Prince how Romeo had tried to stop them, how Mercutio had been wounded under his arm. It was only then, once Mercutio had been killed, that Romeo had attacked Tybalt.

¡®He¡¯s a Montague,¡¯ cried Lady Capulet. ¡®Naturally he¡¯s biased. And he¡¯s lying.: it wasn¡¯t just the two of them fighting ? there were at least twenty. All fighting. I want justice and you must give it to me, Prince. Romeo murdered Tybalt. Romeo must die.¡¯

¡®Romeo killed Tybalt and Tybalt killed Mercutio,¡¯ said the Prince. ¡®Who should pay the price for Tybalt¡¯s death?¡¯

¡®Not Romeo.¡¯ Montague was on his knees. ¡®Not Romeo, Prince. He was Mercutio¡¯s friend. He only did what the law should have done.¡¯

¡®And for that we must exile him.¡¯ The Prince pointed at Capulet and then at Montague. ¡®You¡¯ve dragged me into your hatred now. My own cousin lies there bleeding. I¡¯m going to fine you so heavily that you¡¯ll be sorry for it. I¡¯ll be deaf to all pleas and excuses so don¡¯t even try.¡¯ He looked at Montague. ¡®I¡¯m sick and tired of this. If I¡¯m too lenient there¡¯ll only be more killing. Let Romeo go immediately, else when he¡¯s found that hour will be his last.¡¯"
"Act 3, Scene 2","Juliet was impatient for the night to come. It seemed that the day would go on forever. She wished the god of the sun would whip his horses so that they would carry him faster to the distant west and allow night to fall like a thick curtain. Then her husband could come to her in secret. Who needed daylight? Lovers didn¡¯t: their own beauty was light enough to see by. In any case, if love is blind night is the best time for it.

She sat in her room, marveling at how long a day can be. She thought about what would happen when the night finally fell and Romeo was with her: how she would give herself to him and by so doing, win him forever. The darkness would hide her blushes when they made love. She went to the window and gazed out over the orchard where Romeo had stood.

It was so frustrating: she had bought a house of love but not yet taken possession of it ? she was like some brand new item that hadn¡¯t yet been used. Oh, what tedium: she felt like a child on the night before an important day who has all her new clothes lined up but wasn¡¯t allowed to wear them until morning.

Her Nurse came slowly up the path from the gate. Yes, she had the rope ladder. But she didn¡¯t look very happy. Perhaps she was tired. Juliet left her room, ran as fast as she could -through the halls and down the stairs ? and reached the Nurse before she got to the door.

¡®Hello Nurse,¡¯ she said. ¡®What have you got there? The rope ladder that Romeo asked you to get?¡¯

¡®Yes . , . yes!¡¯ said the Nurse, ¡®The rope ladder.¡¯ Her voice was dull. She sat down on a bench and dropped the ladder. She didn¡¯t look at Juliet: she just shook her head slowly and began wringing her hands.

¡®Oh dear, ¡® said Juliet ¡®What¡¯s wrong? Why are you wringing your hands?¡¯

¡®Oh no, oh no,¡¯ said the Nurse, ¡®He¡¯s dead, he¡¯s dead, he¡¯s dead. It¡¯s all over ? all over, May God help us, he¡¯s gone, he¡¯s killed, he¡¯s dead.¡¯

Juliet went cold. Did she mean Romeo? She was numb, ¡®Can heaven be so hostile?¡¯ she said,

¡®No,¡¯ said the Nurse. ¡®But Romeo can. Oh Romeo, Romeo. Who would have thought it? Romeo!¡¯

¡®What kind of monster are you, saying such things?¡¯ said Juliet. ¡®Torturing me like this? Has Romeo killed himself? Just say yes or no.¡¯

The Nurse still didn¡¯t look up. ¡®I saw the wound with my own eyes. Right here,¡¯ She placed her hand on her breast. ¡®A pitiful corpse, a blood drenched pitiful corpse. It was pale, pale as ashes, and all covered in blood. I fainted when I saw it.¡¯

Juliet lay on the ground and sobbed. Her heart was. broken. She never wanted to open her eyes again. She wanted to die right there and then and be buried in the same coffin as Romeo.

¡®Tybalt, Tybalt,¡¯ wailed the Nurse, ¡®The best friend I had. O dear Tybalt! good Tybalt. I never thought I¡¯d live to see you dead.¡¯

Juliet sat up. ¡®Why are you contradicting yourself?¡¯ she said, ¡®Is Romeo killed? And is Tybalt also dead? Both my beloved cousin and my even more beloved husband? Then come on doomsday, sound your trumpet, because who is alive if those two are dead?¡¯

¡®Tybalt is dead and Romeo banished,¡¯ said the Nurse. ¡®That Romeo who killed Tybalt ? he¡¯s banished.¡¯

¡®Oh God!¡¯ shrieked Juliet, ¡®Did Romeo kill Tybalt?¡¯

¡®He did, he did, oh God help us, he did,¡¯ sobbed the Nurse.

¡®I can¡¯t believe it!,¡¯ exclaimed Juliet. ¡®Oh, the scoundrel. A snake¡¯s heart hidden by a handsome face! Did ever such a beautiful cave harbour such a dragon? A beautiful monster! An angelic devil, Evil in the clothes of good ? just the opposite of what he seemed. I can¡¯t believe that hypocrisy could live in such a gorgeous palace!¡¯

¡®No,¡¯ said the Nurse, ¡®You can¡¯t trust any man: they¡¯re all liars, all hypocrites, ¡®Huh, where¡¯s Peter? Bring me some brandy! All this sorrow is aging me. Shame on Romeo.¡¯

Juliet leapt to her feet. Her eyes flashed as she shook her finger at the Nurse, ¡®I hope your tongue is blistered for saying that!¡¯ she cried, ¡®There¡¯s no shame on Romeo! Oh what a beast I was to criticize him!¡¯
¡®Are you going to speak well of the man who killed your cousin?¡¯

¡®Do you want me to speak badly of the man who is my husband?¡¯ said Juliet. ¡®Oh, my poor husband. Who will support you when I, your wife of three hours, abandons you?¡¯ She shook her head sadly. ¡®But why, scoundrel, did you kill my cousin?¡¯

Peter brought a flask of brandy and the Nurse grabbed it and waved him away.

Juliet had sat down on the grass again. ¡®If he hadn¡¯t killed Tybalt that scoundrel Tybalt would have killed him,¡¯ she said. ¡®Why am I crying? My husband is alive. Tybalt wanted to kill him but Tybalt¡¯s dead now ? the villain who wanted to kill my husband. It¡¯s all good news. So why am I crying? There is something you said, Nurse, that¡¯s worse than Tybalt ¡®s death. I wish I could forget it but it¡¯s haunting me. ¡®Tybalt is dead, and Romeo banished, you said, Nurse. That ¡®banished¡¯, that one word ¡®banished¡¯ is like the death of ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt ¡®s death would have been bad enough if it had ended there. But Romeo¡¯s world¡¯s been destroyed. The word ¡®banished¡¯ is the worst sounding word in our language. Where are my parents, Nurse?¡¯

¡®They¡¯re crying over Tybalt ¡®s body. Do you want to go to them? I¡¯ll take you.¡¯

¡®Are they washing his wounds with tears? I¡¯ve got more tears for Romeo¡¯s banishment than they¡¯ll ever have for Tybalt ¡®s death. Take the rope ladder away. Romeo¡¯s already gone.¡¯ She stood up. ¡®I¡¯m going to bed. And I¡¯ll die there with death as my lover instead of Romeo.¡¯

The Nurse put her arm around Juliet. ¡®That¡¯s right. Go to your room. I¡¯ll try and find Romeo. I think I know where he is. Listen, Love! Romeo will be here tonight. I¡¯ll make sure of that. I¡¯ll go to him: he¡¯s hiding at Friar Lawrence¡¯s chapel.¡¯

¡®Oh find him,¡¯ said Juliet. ¡®Give him this ring and tell him to come to me.¡¯"
"Act 3, Scene 3","¡®Romeo!¡¯ Come out of there. Come out.¡¯ Friar Lawrence had just returned from Verona, dismayed at the events there that afternoon, He stood in front of the stone altar before which he had married the young couple. Romeo had crawled underneath it and he lay now, pressing himself into the darkest corner.
¡®You poor fellow,¡¯ said Friar Lawrence. ¡®So overwhelmed by unhappiness.¡¯

Romeo edged out slowly, His face was pale. He did not get up. ¡®Father, have you any news? What is the Prince¡¯s sentence? What¡¯s going to happen to me?¡¯

¡®It¡¯s not so bad,¡¯ said the Friar, ¡®I¡¯ve brought you news of the sentence.¡¯

¡®What could be ¡®not so bad¡¯ about a death sentence?¡¯

¡®A less harsh sentence: not death but banishment.¡¯

¡®Banishment?¡¯ Romeo rose to his knees and clutched the Friar¡¯s robes. ¡®Oh be merciful, Father. Say ¡®death¡¯. Exile is far more terrifying to me than death. Don¡¯t say ¡®banishment¡¯.¡¯

¡®You¡¯ve been banished from Verona. That¡¯s all. Be grateful. Verona¡¯s not everything: the world¡¯s a big place.¡¯
¡®There¡¯s nothing beyond the walls of Verona,¡¯ said Romeo. ¡®Only torture ? hell itself. So banished means banished from the world, and that means death. ¡®Banished¡¯ is only another word for death.¡¯

¡®Oh sinner,¡¯ said Friar Lawrence. ¡®You ungrateful boy.¡¯ You don¡¯t know how lucky you are. The law calls for your death but the kind Prince has taken your side and ignored the law: he¡¯s converted your sentence to banishment. He¡¯s being merciful and you can¡¯t see it.¡¯

Romeo was crying. He flopped down again. ¡®Torture, not mercy. Heaven is here where Juliet is, and every cat and dog, and little mouse ? every insignificant thing ? can see her but I can¡¯t. Even flies have more rights than I have: they can touch her hand and kiss her lips. But I can¡¯t: I¡¯m banished. Flies can do this but I have to abandon it: they are free men but I am banished. And you say it¡¯s better than death?¡¯ Romeo ¡®s eyes were red and his cheeks were wet. ¡®Haven¡¯t you got some poison or any way of sudden death no matter how nasty? It would be better than banishment. Banished? Oh Friar, the damned use that word in hell. How can you have the heart ? a priest, one who calls himself my friend ? to hack at me with that word ¡®banished¡¯?¡¯

¡®You crazy, foolish young man, listen to me.¡¯ The Friar gripped his shoulders.

Romeo put his hands over his ears. ¡®Oh! you¡¯re going to talk about banishment again.¡¯

¡®Be philosophical,¡¯ the Friar told him. It will comfort you even though you¡¯re banished.¡¯

¡®There you are, Still going on about banishment. To hell with philosophy. Unless philosophy can make a Juliet, move a town, change a prince¡¯s mind, it¡¯s useless. So don¡¯t keep on!¡¯

¡®Oh,¡¯ said the Friar. ¡®You won¡¯t listen. I see that madmen have no ears.¡¯

¡®How could they when wise men have no eyes?¡¯

¡®No,¡¯ said the Friar. ¡®I have to disagree with you. I will eventually persuade you.¡¯

¡®Never! You can¡¯t talk about something you haven¡¯t felt,¡¯ said Romeo. ¡®Look here. If you were my age, and Juliet your love, and you had been married for only an hour and Tybalt had been murdered ? in love like me and like me banished ? then you could talk. You would also tear your hair and grovel on the ground like me, thinking of only one thing: your grave.¡¯

There was a loud, rapid knocking on the door.

¡®Quick, ¡® said the Friar. ¡®Get up! Hide! Quick!¡¯

¡®No,¡¯ said Romeo. ¡®I don ¡®t care what happens to me, I¡¯m not hiding unless I can lose myself in a mist made of my own groans.¡¯

The knocking was louder now.

¡®Listen to that! Who¡¯s there? Get up, Romeo, they¡¯ll catch you!¡¯

More knocking.

¡®Run to my study. And perhaps¡¦¡¯ Friar Lawrence shook his head when Romeo refused to get up ¡®What stupidity is this?¡¯ He turned to the door. ¡®I¡¯m coming, I¡¯m coming!¡¯

The knocking continued. The Friar hurried to the door and pressed his ear to it.

¡®Who¡¯s that? What do you want?¡¯

¡®Let me in,¡¯ a voice called, ¡®And I¡¯ll tell you. The Lady Juliet sent me.¡¯

The Friar slid the bolts back. ¡®Welcome, then,¡¯ he said.

¡®O holy Friar, O tell me holy Friar,¡¯ said the Nurse. ¡®Where ¡®s my lady ¡®s husband? Where ¡®s Romeo?¡¯

The Friar pointed to the interior of the chapel ¡®He¡¯s here, drunk with his own tears.¡¯

¡®Oh, it¡¯s the same with Juliet,¡¯ said the Nurse. Just the same.¡¯ She followed the Friar to the altar where Romeo lay, distraught. ¡®She¡¯s. lying there just like that, blubbering and crying, crying and blubbering.¡¯ She jabbed Romeo with her toe. ¡®Get up. Get up if you¡¯re a man!¡¯ She bent down and took his hand. ¡®For Juliet¡¯s sake, get up.¡¯

Romeo rose unsteadily to his feet. ¡®Nurse, Did you say Juliet¡¯s name? How is she? Doesn¡¯t she think I¡¯m a murderer now that I¡¯ve killed her cousin? Where is she? How is she? What does she say about the end of our love?¡¯

¡®She doesn¡¯t say anything,¡¯ said the Nurse. ¡®She cries and cries ? just throwing herself on her bed then getting up again, calling ¡°Tybalt¡±, then ¡°Romeo¡±, then falling on her bed again.¡¯

¡®As if my name was like a bullet,¡¯ said Romeo. ¡®As though my name¡¯s hand had murdered her cousin.¡¯ He grabbed the Friar¡¯s arm. ¡®Please tell me Friar, whereabout in my body is my name? Tell me so that I can cut it out.¡¯ He pulled out his dagger. Both the Nurse and the Friar leapt at him, He struggled to get his hand free and tried to stab himself. The Friar got him in an arm lock and the Nurse snatched the dagger.

¡®What are you doing?¡¯ said the Friar, ¡®What kind of man are you? You look like a man but your tears are a woman¡¯s and your wild acts are an animal¡¯s. I¡¯m surprised at you. I really thought you more grown up. Perhaps you¡¯ve killed Tybalt but are you going to kill yourself too? And kill the wife who only lives for you?¡¯ The Friar¡¯s voice was raised, ¡®Why are you cursing your birth and heaven and earth? They¡¯re all part of you. Do you want to lose them all by killing yourself?¡¯

The Friar could see that Romeo really wanted to die. He tried to reason with him, speaking fast, telling him that if he killed himself he would be sinning against the love he shared with Juliet as well as against himself, breaking his promise to look after her. ¡®What, man? Pull yourself together. Think about it. It¡¯s all positive. Juliet is alive ? the one you want to die for. That¡¯s a plus. Tybalt wanted to kill you but you killed him instead. That¡¯s a plus. The law that condemned you to death became your friend and turned it to exile. Another plus.¡¯

The Nurse was smiling, gazing at the Friar. Romeo had stopped crying and was listening with bowed head.

¡®You see?¡¯ said the Friar, ¡®It¡¯s all pluses. Happiness follows you and what do you do? You behave like an ungrateful, spoilt child. Be careful, my boy. People like that die miserable.¡¯

He could see that he was getting through to Romeo at last. The young man was standing up properly now! even nodding at his words. The Nurse¡¯s hands were clasped as though in prayer.

¡®Go on,¡¯ continued the Friar, ¡®Go to Juliet, climb up to her room and comfort her.¡¯

Romeo turned.

¡®Wait,¡¯ said the Friar, ¡®Make sure you don ¡®t stay until the Watch goes on duty because then you won¡¯t be able to get away. Go to Mantua. That¡¯s where you¡¯re going to live until we get the chance to announce your marriage. We¡¯ll beg the Prince¡¯s pardon and you¡¯ll be able to come back. Joyfully. Go on Nurse. Run ahead and tell her to try and get everyone to go to bed early ? which they¡¯ll probably do anyway because of their grief. Tell her Romeo is on his way.¡¯

¡®Oh Lord!¡¯ said the Nurse. I could stand here all night listening to good advice like this. What it is to have an education! Here.¡¯ She held a ring out to Romeo. ¡®She told me to give this to you. Hurry now, because it¡¯s getting late.¡¯

¡®I¡¯m alright now.¡¯ Said Romeo when the Nurse had gone.

¡®Go on,¡¯ said the Friar. ¡®Good night. And listen. Either set off before the Watch comes or leave in disguise. Stay in Mantua. I¡¯ll keep you informed: I¡¯ll send your man as soon as there¡¯s any news.¡¯"
"Act 3, Scene 4","Lady Capulet watched the two men. Her husband stood at the window, his hand on Paris¡¯ shoulder.

¡®With all these sad things we haven¡¯t had time to persuade our daughter. Look here! She loved her cousin Tybalt dearly, and so did I.¡¯ He sighed. ¡®Well, we all have to die.¡¯

He looked apprehensively at his wife, who was reclining on a sofa. ¡®It¡¯s very late,¡¯ he continued, his voice low. ¡®She won¡¯t come down tonight. I must say, if you hadn¡¯t been here I would have been in bed long ago.¡¯

Paris thought it best to leave. ¡®This is the wrong time for such matters,¡¯ he said. He went and stood before Lady Capulet. ¡®Good night, Madam, Give your daughter my compliments.¡¯

¡®I will , said Lady Capulet. ¡®And I¡¯ll let you know what she says early tomorrow. She¡¯s heartbroken tonight.¡¯

As Paris was about to leave Capulet called him back. ¡®On second thoughts, I¡¯ll take the risk and say yes. She¡¯ll do as I tell her.¡¯ He snapped his fingers. ¡®Wife, go and see her in the morning and tell her about my son Paris¡¯ love for her. And tell her ? listen ? tell her next Wednesday. Wait, What¡¯s today?¡¯

¡®Monday,¡¯ said Paris,

¡®Monday?¡¯ Capulet laughed. ¡®Well Wednesday is too soon. Thursday. Make it Thursday. Tell her she¡¯s getting married to this noble earl on Thursday.¡¯ Capulet looked sharply at Paris. ¡®Will you be ready then? Is it too soon?¡¯ He didn¡¯t wait for an answer.

¡®We won¡¯t make a fuss about it ? just a friend or two. Because, listen. Tybalt being murdered so recently, it would be disrespectful if we celebrated too much. So we¡¯ll just have about a half a dozen friends and that¡®ll be it. But what do you say to Thursday?¡¯

Paris took Capulet¡¯s hands in his own, ¡®My Lord, I wish tomorrow was Thursday.¡¯

¡®Well off you go then. Thursday it is.¡¯ He saw Paris out then turned to his wife. ¡®Go to Juliet, wife,¡¯ he said. ¡®Prepare her for her wedding day. Light!¡¯ he shouted. ¡®Hey! Light to my room!¡¯ He followed the servant, muttering. ¡®It¡¯s so late that we should really call it morning.¡¯"
"Act 3, Scene 5","¡®You¡¯re not going!¡¯ said Juliet. ¡®It¡¯s not morning yet.¡¯

Romeo lay down beside her again and kissed her. ¡®It really is morning,¡¯ he said. ¡®The clouds in the eastern sky are streaked with light. I have to leave if I¡¯m going stay alive, or die if I don¡¯t.¡¯

¡®That light isn¡¯t daylight,¡¯ she said. ¡®I know that: it¡¯s like some meteor sent to light you on you way to Mantua. So stay: you don¡¯t have to go.¡¯

¡®No,¡¯ he said. ¡®I don¡¯t. Let them catch me, let them put me to death. I¡¯m happy if it¡¯s what you want. I¡¯d rather stay. I welcome death if it¡¯s what you want.¡¯ He kissed her again. ¡®How are you my darling? Let¡¯s talk: it¡¯s not day yet.¡¯

¡®Oh, it is, it is!¡¯ she cried. You must go. Hurry. Come on, go. It¡¯s getting lighter every moment.¡¯

Romeo groaned. ¡®The lighter it gets the darker our troubles become.¡¯

The Nurse, who had been keeping guard all night, knocked softly on the door and opened it.

¡®Juliet!¡¯

¡®Nurse, what is it?¡¯

¡®Your mother¡¯s coming to your room It¡¯s morning. Be careful.¡¯ She closed the door.

They kissed again and again then he finally let the rope ladder down. Juliet hung out the window.

¡®Have you really gone, my Love, my husband, friend? I want to hear from you every hour of every day. Each minute will drag like many days, so I¡¯ll be very old before I see my Romeo again.¡¯

Romeo stood in the orchard. ¡®Good bye,¡¯ he said. ¡®I¡¯ll send a message as soon as I can.¡¯

¡®Oh, do you think we will ever meet again?¡¯

¡®Of course,¡¯ he said. ¡®And all this trouble will be a good talking point.¡¯

¡®Oh God, I¡¯ve got a terrible feeling about this,¡¯ she said. ¡®Seeing you down there. It¡¯s like seeing you dead at the bottom of a grave.¡¯

¡®It¡¯s only our sadness that gives you that feeling,¡¯ he said. And he disappeared among the trees.

As she watched her husband out of sight the old saying about Fortune being fickle was on Juliet¡¯s mind. If so, what was Fortune doing with someone as faithful as Romeo was? She wished Fortune would be fickle now and change its mind about Romeo and let him come back soon. She heard her mother calling. What was she doing up so early? Or had she been up all night? It wasn¡¯t like her to come to her room at this time of morning. What did she want?

As soon as Lady Capulet saw her daughter¡¯s pale, tearstained face she stopped. ¡®What¡¯s the matter, Juliet?¡¯ she said.

¡®I¡¯m not well,¡¯ said Juliet.

¡®Still crying for your cousin? What are you trying to do? Wash him from his grave with tears? Even if you could that wouldn¡¯t bring him back to life. So stop now. An appropriate amount of grief shows a lot of love but too much shows a lack of brains.¡¯

¡®I can¡¯t stop crying: I feel his loss so deeply,¡¯ said Juliet.

¡®It still won¡¯t bring him back,¡¯ said her mother. ¡®Rather cry because that scoundrel who killed him is alive.¡¯

¡®What scoundrel?¡¯

¡®Romeo!¡¯ said Lady Capulet.

Juliet thought of how far Romeo was from being a scoundrel. She spoke cautiously. ¡®May God pardon him. And yet no-one causes me as much sadness as he does.¡¯

¡®That¡¯s because the murderous traitor is still alive.¡¯

¡®Yes, Mother,¡¯ said Juliet. The last thing she could bear to think about was someone killing Romeo in revenge. ¡®I¡¯d 1ike no-one but me to avenge my cousin¡¯s death.¡¯

¡®We¡¯ll have revenge, don¡¯t you worry about that,¡¯ said her mother. ¡®So stop crying. I¡¯ll send someone to a man in Mantua ? where that criminal¡¯s gone to live ? and he¡¯ll give him such an unexpected dose of poison that he¡¯ll soon be keeping Tybalt company. And then I hope you¡¯ll be satisfied.¡¯

Juliet would never be satisfied until she saw Romeo again. Her heart was breaking to hear his name and not be able to go to him.

¡®I¡¯ll find the man,¡¯ said her mother. She smiled suddenly. ¡®Let¡¯s put that behind us now because I¡¯ve got some joyful news, girl.¡¯

¡®It¡¯s about time I had some joyful news. What is it, Mother?¡¯

¡®Well.¡¯ Her mother sat down on the bed. ¡®You¡¯ve got a thoughtful father, my child.

To help you through this bereavement he¡¯s sorted something out. Something you didn¡¯t expect.¡¯

Juliet wished her mother would go away and leave her but she answered. ¡®And what¡¯s that Mother?¡¯

¡®Well here it is.¡¯ Lady Capulet ¡®s eyes shone, ¡®Early on Thursday morning¡¦ the charming, young and noble gentleman, the Count of Paris, at St. Peter¡¯s church¡¦¡¯ Juliet stared at her.¡®¡¦Will make a joyful bride of you!¡¯

Juliet sprang up. ¡®No! By St Peter ¡®s Church and by St Peter too, if you like, he will not make a joyful bride of me. I can¡¯t believe this haste ? that I should get married before the man who¡¯s going to be my husband comes to court me!¡¯ Tears of rage shone in her eyes. ¡®Please tell my father that I don¡¯t want to get married yet and when I do I swear it will be to Romeo ? who you know I hate ? before I marry Paris. What kind of joyful news is this?¡¯

The door opened. ¡®Well here¡¯s your father now,¡¯ said Lady Capulet. Tell him yourself and see what he¡¯ll do.¡¯

Capulet¡¯s face showed concern as he looked at his daughter. Tears streamed down her cheeks. ¡®It often drizzles at sunset,¡¯ he said. ¡®But at the sunset of my nephew¡¯s life it¡¯s a downpour.¡¯

He sat on the bed beside her and took her hand. ¡®Still crying?¡¯. Juliet¡¯s sobbing increased and her father put his arm round her and pulled her close. ¡®A whole storm,¡¯ he said. ¡®Such shaking.¡¯ He turned to his wife. ¡®Have you told her of my decision?¡¯.

¡®I have,¡¯ said his wife. ¡®But she won¡¯t have it. She thanks you and declines. I wish the idiot was married to her grave!¡¯

Capulet pushed Juliet away from him gently and stood up. ¡®Slowly,¡¯ he said. ¡®I¡¯m not following. What? She won¡¯t have it? Isn¡¯t she grateful?¡¯ He was looking incredulously from one to the other. ¡®Isn¡¯t she proud? Isn¡¯t she counting her blessings, insignificant as she is, that we have found such an important gentleman to be her husband?¡¯

Juliet tried to find the right words. ¡®No, not proud that you¡¯ve found him. Thankful that you have. I can never be proud of something that I don¡¯t want but I¡¯m thankful for what you¡¯ve done because you intended it as love.¡¯

Capulet was staring at her. His face was red. ¡®What! What! What¡¯s this? ¡°Proud¡± and ¡°thankful¡± and ¡°no thank you¡±? Listen here, little girl. Don¡¯t give me any of your thanks and your prouds or any of that. Just get yourself ready to go with Paris to St Peter¡¯s church on Friday or I will drag you there on a piece of fencing!¡¯ He paced up and down the room rapidly, his face contorted. Then he swung round and ran towards Juliet. ¡®You insipid piece of rotting flesh! You little whore. You white faced¡¦¡¯ He took a swing at her and hit her across the face.

Lady Capulet rushed between them and got in the way just as her husband¡¯s hand was about to come down again. ¡®Stop it!¡¯ she cried. ¡®Are you mad?¡¯ She grasped his arm and held it firmly. The Nurse was crouching in a corner.

¡®Father,¡¯ said Juliet. Her face was stinging. She slipped from the bed and fell to her knees. ¡®I beg of you, just let me say one thing. Please!¡¯

¡®Hang you! You whore. Disobedient wretch!¡¯ he bellowed. He advanced on her again but both his wife and the Nurse came between them. ¡®I¡¯ll tell you what,¡¯ he stormed, ¡®You get yourself to that church on Thursday or never ask me for anything again!¡¯

Juliet opened her mouth to speak.

¡®Don¡¯t say anything¡¯ said Capulet. ¡®Nothing. Don¡¯t even answer me. My fingers are itching.¡¯

His wife was still holding on to his raised arm. He lowered it now and wiped his brow on his sleeve. ¡®Wife,¡¯ he said. ¡®We thought God had done us down by letting us have this only child but now I see that we are cursed in having even her.¡¯ He raised his arm again and all three cowered. ¡®Damn her, worthless child!¡¯ he yelled.

¡®May God in heaven help her,¡¯ said the Nurse. She couldn¡¯t take it any more and came forward now. ¡®Shame on you, Sir, for treating her like this.¡¯

¡®What?¡¯ said Capulet, turning on the Nurse. ¡®So you¡¯re the fountain of wisdom now, are you?¡¯ he sneered. ¡®Go and gossip with your cronies.¡¯

¡®I¡¯m only speaking the truth.¡¯

¡®Get out of my sight,¡¯ said Capulet.

¡®Can¡¯t one even speak?¡¯

¡®I told you to shut up, you mumbling fool Go and speak your wisdom over a gossip¡¯s bowl. We don¡¯t need your opinion here.¡¯

Lady Capulet took his hand. ¡®You¡¯re over reacting, she said.

¡®God, it makes me mad,¡¯ said Capulet. ¡®Every day and night, every moment, whether working or playing, alone or in company, my only ambition has been to make a good match. And now, when I finally find a gentleman with aristocratic connections, with property, young, noble blood, absolutely full of good qualities, built exactly as any man could want to be. And then to have a wretched crying idiot, a whining doll, staring her fortune in the face and answering -Capulet imitated a lisping girl ? ¡°I don¡¯t think I¡¯ll get married, I can¡¯t love him, I¡¯m too young. Please excuse me.¡± His eyes blazed. He shook his finger at Juliet. ¡®Eat where you like, you won¡¯t stay here. So think about that! I¡¯m not joking. Thursday is close. Search your soul and give it some serious thought. If you belong to me I¡¯ll give you to my friend: if you don¡¯t, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets. As long as I live I won¡¯t own you. And you won¡¯t get a penny. You¡¯d better believe it: I won¡¯t change my mind.¡¯

When he had gone they all looked at each other. The Nurse¡¯s eyes were all sympathy but ? Lady Capulet¡¯s look was hard.

Isn¡¯t there any pity in heaven?¡¯ said Juliet, sobbing. ¡®Anything that can see how miserable I am?¡¯ She tried to take her mother¡¯s hand but Lady Capulet snatched it away. ¡®Oh sweet mother don¡¯t push me away,¡¯ said Juliet ¡®Postpone this marriage for a month ? a week. Or if you won¡¯t then make the bridal bed in that dark tomb where Tybalt¡¯s lying.¡¯

¡®Don¡¯t talk to me,¡¯ said her mother, ¡®I¡¯m not saying another word. You heard your father, Do as you 1ike. I¡¯ve finished with you.¡¯ And she hurried out,

¡®Oh God. Oh Nurse, what are we going to do?¡¯ said Juliet, ¡®I¡¯ve got a husband. How can I get married while my husband ¡®s alive? Tell me what to do. How can heaven do this to someone as vulnerable as I am? What do you say? Can¡¯t you give me any comfort?¡¯

¡®There is some comfort, said the Nurse, ¡®This is it. Romeo is banished and might as well be dead. He can¡¯t come back here to challenge anything you do ? or if he does it has to be in secret. So as that is the reality I think the best thing is to marry the Count.¡¯

Juliet couldn¡¯t believe her only friend was saying this.

¡®Oh, he¡¯s a lovely gentleman,¡¯ continued the Nurse. ¡®Romeo¡¯s a dishcloth compared to him. Even an eagle doesn¡¯t have as noble a profile as Paris has. I¡¯m completely convinced that this is the best match ? much better than the first. But even if it weren¡¯t your first love is as good as dead. Living in Mantua he¡¯s not much use to you, is he?¡¯

¡®Do you mean all that?¡¯ said Juliet.

¡®Every word,¡¯ said the Nurse.

¡®That¡¯s it then.¡¯

¡®What?¡¯

¡®Well you¡¯ve really comforted me. Go and tell my mother I¡¯ve gone to Lawrence¡¯s chapel to confess that I¡¯ve displeased my father and to ask for forgiveness.¡¯

The Nurse, all smiles now, was up in a moment. ¡®I¡¯m on my way. This is the right thing.

As Juliet was dressing her thoughts about the Nurse were not pleasant She was a wicked old woman, a most evil devil. Which sin was worse ? wanting her to break her vow or running Romeo down? She had condemned Romeo with the same tongue she had used to praise him ? to put him beyond comparison ? thousands of times. As she slipped out of the house she resolved that she would never confide in her Nurse again. She would go to Friar Lawrence to see if there was anything he could do, Failing all else she would kill herself."
"Act 4, Scene 1","¡®Thursday?¡¯ said Friar Lawrence. ¡®That¡¯s short notice.¡¯

¡®It¡¯s what my father-to-be wants,¡¯ said Paris. ¡®And I¡¯m happy to go along with it.¡¯

Friar Lawrence rubbed his chin. ¡® You  say you don¡¯t know what she feels about it? Hmm. That¡¯s no good. I don¡¯t like it.¡¯

It was another hot morning. Friar Lawrence led the young man towards the cool of his chapel

¡®She¡¯s been grieving terribly for Tybalt so I haven¡¯t approached her,¡¯ said the young count.

¡®Well Sir, her father¡¯s not happy about the way she¡¯s taken her cousin¡¯s death and thinks her marriage will make her forget the tragedy more quickly. He thinks being by herself and dwelling on it¡¯s bad: it¡¯s better if she has something else to think about. And that¡¯s the reason for having the wedding so soon.¡¯

Friar Lawrence could see the logic of that but he knew it was essential to delay the wedding although he wished he did not know the reason for that. As they got to the door of the chapel he saw Juliet hurrying towards them. She stopped when she recognized Paris. He smiled and took her hand. He raised it to his lips.

¡®How nice to see you,¡¯ he said. ¡®My love, my wife.¡¯

¡®You may call me that when I am a wife,¡¯ she said. She and the Friar exchanged glances.

The Friar could see her impatience and he could also see that she had been crying. Paris did not seem to notice any of that.

¡®I may call you my wife,¡¯ he said. ¡®Or must do so, Love, on Thursday.¡¯

¡®What must happen will happen,¡¯ said Juliet.

¡®Oh yes,¡¯ said Friar Lawrence. ¡®That¡¯s one thing we can be sure of.¡¯ He wished Paris would go.

¡®Have you come to confess to this holy father?¡¯ said Paris.

¡®It¡¯s none of your business.¡¯

¡®When you do make your confession, don¡¯t say you don¡¯t love me.¡¯

¡®I¡¯ll confess to you that I love the holy father.¡¯ She gave Friar Lawrence a desperate look.

¡®And I know you¡¯ll tell him you love me,¡¯ said Paris.

¡®If I do that,¡¯ she said, ¡®it will be worth more behind your back than to your face.¡¯

¡®Poor soul,¡¯ he said. ¡®Tears have spoilt your face.¡¯

¡®Then the tears haven¡¯t achieved much,¡¯ she said. ¡®My face was bad enough before they started.¡¯

¡®Don¡¯t say that it¡¯s not true.¡¯

¡®I¡¯m not ashamed of the truth,¡¯ she said. ¡®Especially as I said it to my own face.¡¯

¡®Your face is mine said Paris. ¡®And you have slandered it.¡¯

¡®My face may as well be yours because its not mine,¡¯ she said impatiently. She turned her back on him abruptly. ¡®Are you free now holy Father, or shall I come back at evening mass?¡¯

¡®I¡¯m free now, sad daughter,¡¯ said the Friar. ¡®My Lord, I must ask you to leave us now.¡¯

¡®God forbid that I should interfere with devotion!¡¯ said the Count. ¡®Juliet, I¡¯ll come early on Thursday. Until then, goodbye.¡¯ He bent forward and kissed her cheek before she had time to move out of his way.

Juliet stood stiff and immobile until he had gone then she dashed past the Friar. ¡®Shut the door¡¯, she said. ¡®And come and cry with me ? past hope, past cure, past help.¡¯

¡®Oh Juliet,¡¯ The Friar stroked her hair. ¡®I already know what¡¯s happened. It¡¯s taxed my brains to bursting point. I hear you have to marry the Count on Thursday.¡¯

¡®Don¡¯t give me the whole story,¡¯ she snapped. ¡®Just tell me what to do.¡¯ She opened her bag and took out a small knife. ¡®If you can¡¯t help me then I¡¯ll help myself. With this.¡¯

The Friar took the knife from her.

¡®God joined my heart and Romeo¡¯s and you joined our hands. Before this hand does anything else I¡¯ll use it to kill myself. So you¡¯d better either give me some advice or watch me die.¡¯ She reached for the knife but he whisked it out of her way. ¡®Don¡¯t take so long,¡¯ she said. ¡®Speak up. I¡¯m longing to die, and will if you don¡¯t give me another solution.¡¯

The Friar didn¡¯t answer immediately. When he did, it was with reluctance. ¡®I think there¡¯s a ray of hope,¡¯ he said. ¡®It needs a desperate remedy ? as desperate as the situation you¡¯re in. If you really would sooner kill yourself than marry Paris then I think you¡¯d be prepared to take this on. You¡¯d have to go through something like death, though. If you dare then I¡¯ll give you the remedy.

¡®Oh you can tell me to do anything rather than marry Paris,¡¯ she cried. ¡®Tell me to jump from the battlements of any tower, or go out and steal. Tell me to go into a snakepit: chain me up with fierce bears. Make me spend every night in a charnel-house, covered in dead men¡¯s rattling bones, with shinbones running with stinking slime, and yellow skulls with their bottom jaws missing. Or tell me to go into a new grave and snuggle up to a dead man in his shroud ? things that would make anyone shudder. And I will do it without hesitation if it means I¡¯ll be able to live a pure and faithful wife to my love.¡¯

¡®Alright then,¡¯ said the Friar. ¡®I¡¯m convinced. Here¡¯s the plan. Go home, put on a happy face. Agree to marry Paris. Tomorrow is Wednesday. Now look here. Make sure that when you go to bed you¡¯re alone in your room. Don¡¯t let your nurse in.¡¯

The Friar went to a chest and unlocked it He took out a small bottle. ¡®Here. This is it. When you¡¯re in bed drink the liquid. In a little while your body fluids will grow cold and you will have no pulse. There¡¯ll be no warmth and no breath to show that you¡¯re alive. The colour in your face will go and your eyes will close as though in death. Your limbs will be stiff and cold like a corpse¡¯s.¡¯ He paused. Juliet held out her hand.
¡®Then, when the bridegroom arrives to wake you up on your wedding day, there you¡¯ll be: dead! After forty-two hours you¡¯ll wake up as though from a pleasant sleep.¡¯

Juliet smiled for the first time. ¡®And then, according to custom, they¡¯ll dress you in your best clothes and take you to the ancient tomb where all the Capulets are laid to rest. In the meantime, while I¡¯m waiting for you to wake up, I¡¯ll send a letter to Romeo and he¡¯ll come here. And he and I will watch you wake up and that very night he¡¯ll take you off to Mantua. That is the solution if you have the courage to go through with it.¡¯

¡®Give me, give me,¡¯ said Juliet. ¡®Don¡¯t talk to me about fear.¡¯

¡®Here.¡¯ He gave her the bottle. ¡®Go now. Be strong and don¡¯t weaken. I¡¯ll send a friar to Mantua immediately, with a letter to Romeo.¡¯

Juliet was almost lighthearted as she went home to carry out the plan. She couldn¡¯t wait for night to fall."
"Act 4, Scene 2","Capulet was doing what he enjoyed most. He gave a list to a servant with instructions to go out and find the guests and invite them: he sent another servant to hire twenty cooks. He was afraid that things wouldn¡¯t be ready in time.

The Nurse was telling Lady Capulet where Juliet had gone. Capulet overheard the tail-end and turned. ¡®What? Has my daughter gone to Friar Lawrence?¡¯

¡®Yes.¡¯

¡®Well, perhaps he¡¯ll be able to knock some sense into her. What a willful little slut she is.¡¯

¡®Oh look, Sir, here she is, and looking so cheerful.¡¯

¡®Hello, little Miss Headstrong,¡¯ said Capulet. ¡®And where have you been gadding about?¡¯

¡®Where I¡¯ve learnt to repent of the sin of disobedience. Friar Lawrence made me promise to fall down at your feet and beg your pardon.¡¯ She knelt in front of him. ¡®Pardon, I beg of you. From now on I¡¯ll do as I¡¯m told.¡¯

Capulet laughed. He snapped his fingers at a passing servant. ¡®Send for the Count,¡¯ he said, He rubbed his hands together. ¡®We¡¯ll speed it up. I¡¯ll have this knot tied up tomorrow morning.¡¯

¡®I met the Count at Lawrence¡¯s chapel¡¯ said Juliet. ¡®And offered him what love I could without stepping beyond the bounds of modesty.¡¯

¡®That¡¯s excellent,¡¯ said her father. ¡®Get up, daughter That¡¯s how it should be. I want to see the Count.. What? Haven¡¯t gone yet?¡¯ he asked the servant ¡®Go on now, in the name of God, and get the friar too. Our whole city is indebted to this reverend holy friar.¡¯

Juliet took her Nurse¡¯s hand and they got up to choose the things she would wear at her wedding.

¡®That¡¯s right, Nurse,¡¯ said Capulet. ¡®Go and help her. We¡¯ll go to church tomorrow.¡¯

Lady Capulet didn¡¯t much like the haste. ¡®We won¡¯t be ready,¡¯ she said.

¡®Don¡¯t worry, ¡® said her husband. ¡®I¡¯ll get on with it. It¡¯ll all work out, I guarantee. You go to Juliet. Help her get decked out. I won¡¯t go to bed tonight. Leave it all to me.¡¯ He looked around. The servant he had sent to fetch Paris hadn¡¯t gone yet: he was. busy doing some other preparation work. Oh well, he would walk to Paris himself and tell him that the wedding had been brought forward a day. He was in a good mood: his wayward daughter had come back into the fold of his love and everything was going according to plan."
"Act 4, Scene 3","Juliet didn¡¯t argue with the Nurse¡¯s choice of clothes for the wedding, nor did she complain about the incessant chatter about how wonderful Paris was. ¡®Yes, yes, Nurse,¡¯ she said. ¡®I agree with you: these clothes are best.¡¯

It seemed that the Nurse was going to take forever to lay them out. When she had finished at last, she went into the anteroom where she had her own bed. Juliet followed her and sat on the bed. ¡®Please, Nurse,¡¯ she said, ¡®Leave me to myself tonight. I¡¯m going to spend the night praying that things will turn out better. You know what a mess it all is.¡¯

Lady Capulet appeared at the door, ¡®You¡¯ve been busy,¡¯ she said. ¡®Are you all ready or do you need my help?¡¯

¡®No thanks,¡¯ said Juliet. ¡®We¡¯ve done everything. ¡®Please let me be alone now. And take Nurse with you ? she can stay up and help you: I ¡®m sure you all have your hands full with everything that has to be done before tomorrow.¡¯

When they had gone Juliet wondered when she would see them again. She went to a little cabinet and took out the bottle the Friar had given her. There was a dagger in there as well and she placed it on the cabinet¡¯s top, Then she drew the curtains around the bed and lay down.

As she thought about what she had to do fear began to take hold of her. It spread through her veins like iced water and almost paralyzed her. She wanted to call them back and actually opened her mouth and formed the word ¡®Nurse¡¯ before pulling herself together. What could the Nurse do for her now? She was alone.

She was clutching the bottle She opened her hand now and looked at it. What if it didn¡¯t work?. Did that mean she¡¯d have to be married tomorrow? She reached for the dagger and placed it beside her on the bed. She¡¯d use it if she had to. She lifted the bottle again. What if it were some poison that the Friar had given her because he wanted her dead? In case they should blame him for her marriage to Romeo? She was convinced of it when she thought about it and yet it couldn¡¯t be: everyone knew he was a holy man.

What if she was in the tomb and woke up before Romeo came to fetch her? That was too horrible to think about. She¡¯d suffocate in the vault ? choke in the stench of death ? and die, strangled, before Romeo came. Even if she didn¡¯t die there wouldn¡¯t she go mad? Just to think about all those dead bodies: all those corpses! It was a vault where her dead ancestors had been packed for hundreds of years. Tybalt. He was there. Not so long dead. He would be decomposing! And they say that at certain times of night ghosts visit the newly dead. She sat up and looked fearfully at the thick curtains.

She was sure that if she woke earlier than planned ? with those loathsome smells and the shrieks of the dead ? she would go mad and she would do some desperate things: she would play with her ancestors¡¯ remains and pull the dead Tybalt out of his shroud, and even perhaps take one of her great ancestor¡¯s bones and bash her own brains out with it.

Even here in her bedroom, she was starting to see things. Tybalt ¡®s ghost was walking about, looking for Romeo.

¡®No,¡¯ she shouted. ¡®Don¡¯t Tybalt. ¡®Stop.¡¯

She uncorked the bottle and raised it to her lips. ¡®Romeo! Romeo! Romeo!¡¯ she cried. ¡®I drink to you!¡¯. She flung the bottle from her and fell back on the bed."
"Act 4, Scene 5","¡®Mistress. Wake up¡¦ Juliet?¡¯. The Nurse stood in the middle of the room with her hands on her hips. ¡®Juliet!¡¯. The child was fast asleep behind those curtains. ¡®Hello lamb. Lady. Shame on you, you lazybones.¡¯ Still nothing. She¡¯d try the soft approach. ¡®Lo-ove. Madam. Sweetheart. Hey bride!.¡¯ ¡®Nothing to say? Ho ho ho. Get your money¡¯s worth of sleep for a week. Because I¡¯ll bet Paris has no intention of letting you sleep tonight.¡¯ She giggled. ¡®God forgive me, stop it now, Nurse.¡¯

But it was strange how sound asleep Juliet was. She had to wake her, though. ¡®Madam¡¦ Madam¡¦ Madam! Well, the Count will just have to take you in your bed. He¡¯ll wake you up with a big fright, won¡¯t he?¡¯

She pulled one of the curtains aside. ¡®What¡¯s this? Dressed already? And gone back to bed?¡¯ The Nurse put her hand on Juliet¡¯s shoulder and shook her. ¡®Lady. Lady¡¦ Lady.¡¯

She stared.

¡®Oh no,¡¯ she said softly. ¡®Oh no.¡¯ Then, louder: ¡®Help.¡¯ Then she turned her head and screamed. ¡®Help! My lady¡¯s dead.¡¯ She looked at the pitiful sight on the bed and shook her head. ¡®I wish I¡¯d never been born.¡¯
She ran to the door. ¡®Some brandy here! Hurry! My Lord! My Lady!¡¯

Lady Capulet came rushing up the stairs and ran across the hall. ¡®What¡¯s all the noise?¡¯ she said.

The Nurse moaned and pointed at the bed.

¡®What¡¯s the matter?¡¯ said Lady Capulet.

¡®Look, look! Oh heavy day¡¯

Lady Capulet gasped. She ran to the bed. ¡®Oh¡¦ oh¡¦ my child. My only life. Wake up please, please, wake up, or I¡¯ll die with you.¡¯ She turned her tear stained face to the Nurse, ¡®Get help. Quickly!¡¯

Capulet came into the room. ¡®What¡¯s going on? Come on! Bring Juliet down. Her husband¡¯s arrived.¡¯

The two women began wailing. ¡®She¡¯s dead, she¡¯s dead, she¡¯s dead,¡¯ they repeated.

¡®Ha,¡¯ said Capulet. He strode to the bed. ¡®Let me look at her.¡¯ He stared at her for a long time. Then he put his hand on her forehead. ¡®She¡¯s cold.¡¯ His voice sounded as though it was miles away. ¡®Her blood¡¯s stopped flowing and she¡¯s stiff. She¡¯s been dead for hours. How pitiful to see her. So young. Death has taken her like frost takes a beautiful flower.¡¯

The Nurse and Lady Capulet knelt beside the bed and wailed. Capulet dropped to his knees too but couldn¡¯t say anything now. There was a knock on the open door. Friar Lawrence and Paris stood there with a troupe of musicians, waiting for the signal to serenade the Count¡¯s bride.

¡®All ready to go to church?¡¯ said the Friar.

¡®She¡¯s ready to go and never return,¡¯ said Capulet. He got up and went to Paris. ¡®Oh son, Death has beaten you to it. He slept with her last night.¡¯ He put his arm round the young man¡¯s shoulders and guided him to the bed. ¡®There she is,¡¯ he said. Death is my son-in-law: Death is my heir: he has married my daughter. I will die now and leave him everything. Everything belongs to Death now.¡¯

¡®How I¡¯ve looked forward to this morning,¡¯ said Paris. ¡®And what a sight it brings me.¡¯
Lady Capulet¡¯s wailing grew louder and more heartrending. The Nurse was beside herself and wailed even louder than her mistress.

Paris bent over Juliet and took her hand. ¡®Tricked,¡¯ he said. ¡®Divorced, wronged, destroyed. She¡¯s been tricked by death,¡¯ He kissed her hand. ¡®Oh life,¡¯ he said, ¡®No, not life. This is love in death.¡¯
Capulet broke down now, and gave himself up to his grief.

Friar Lawrence¡¯s satisfaction at the success of his plan was tempered by the grief all around him. For a moment he was sorry for what he had done but then he remembered what would have happened if he hadn¡¯t done it. ¡®Be quiet, all of you,¡¯ he said ¡®You should be ashamed of yourselves. You can¡¯t bring her back by behaving like this.¡¯

They all took notice of the holy man ? stopped their wailing and listened.

¡®She wasn¡¯t yours entirely: you shared her with heaven. And now heaven¡¯s got everything. But she¡¯s better off for it. You could never have kept your share of her from Death but heaven can give her eternal life. You wanted to do well by her and now you¡¯re crying when she ¡®s gone to heaven. You don¡¯t love your child very much if you go mad when you see how well she is. And in any case, long marriages are never happy: it¡¯s just as well to die young.¡¯

The Friar put his hand out to Lady Capulet and raised her up. ¡®Dry your tears and put rosemary on this beautiful corpse. Dress her in her best clothes and take her to church. It¡¯s natural to cry but not sensible since she¡¯s gone to heaven.¡¯

¡®Everything,¡¯ said Capulet, sobbing. ¡®Everything that we¡¯ve prepared for her wedding will mark her funeral now. Our musical instruments will be changed to mournful bells, our celebration to a wake, our hymns to funeral dirges, our bridal flowers to a wreath ? everything has become its opposite.¡¯

Friar Lawrence took his arm. ¡®Come on, Sir, you must go now. And you too, Madam.¡¯ Paris lingered and the Friar waited for him. ¡®Come on, Sir Paris,¡¯ he said. ¡®All of you go and prepare to follow this corpse to her grave. The heavens are frowning on you for something you¡¯ve done. Don¡¯t make things worse.¡¯

They went sadly from the room, leaving the musicians staring at Juliet. One of them stopped the Nurse. ¡®I suppose we might as well put our instruments away and go home?¡¯ he said.

¡®Yes, lads,¡¯ said the Nurse. ¡®Put them away, put them away, because you can see what a sad case this is.¡¯"
"Act 5, Scene 1","Romeo had been in a good mood all morning. He¡¯d had a dream that he was about to receive some good news. He was lighthearted and he walked through the streets of Mantua feeling that his feet weren¡¯t touching the ground.

His dream was that Juliet had found him dead. And although it was an odd dream that allowed a dead man to think and feel, she had brought him back to life with her kisses and made him as happy as a king. He smiled as he walked. It just showed how wonderful the real thing was if even dreams about love could make you feel so good Wasn¡¯t that his man, Balthasar, coming down the street? It was. It must be good news from Verona.

¡®Balthazar,¡¯ he said. ¡®Have you got a letter from the Friar? How¡¯s my wife? And my father? Is he alright?¡¯ Romeo did a little jig, dancing round his servant. ¡®How¡¯s my Juliet? I¡¯m asking that because if she¡¯s well then everything is wonderful.¡¯

Balthazar said nothing. He stared at the ground, avoiding Romeo¡¯s eyes. Romeo stopped his dancing. Balthazar was crying.

¡®She¡¯s well. So nothing can be wrong,¡¯ said Balthazar. He turned his back on Romeo and blurted: ¡®Her body¡¯s sleeping in Capulet¡¯s tomb and her soul¡¯s among the angels.¡¯

Romeo felt cold, even in that terrible heat. His expression queried his servant¡¯s statement.

¡®I watched them putting her in their family vault, said Balthasar, ¡®and then came straight to you.¡¯ He saw the pain in Romeo¡¯s face and wished he could think of some way of comforting him

¡®It can¡¯t be!¡¯ said Romeo at last. He turned away. ¡®The stars are against us. But I won¡¯t give in to them!¡¯ He turned back to Balthasar. ¡®Go and get me some paper and ink and hire us some horses.¡¯

¡®I beg of you, Sir,¡¯ said Balthasar, ¡®be careful You¡¯re upset and I¡¯m worried that something bad is going to happen.¡¯

¡®You¡¯re wrong,¡¯ said Romeo. ¡®Just do as I tell you. Haven¡¯t you got a letter from the Friar?¡¯

¡®No.¡¯

¡®It doesn¡¯t matter. Go and get the horses. I¡¯ll see you later.¡¯

Romeo had made up his mind. He would sleep with Juliet that night. The only question was what means should he use to kill himself? He felt nothing ? his only thought was to get to Juliet and be with her forever.
He remembered seeing a chemist¡¯s shop nearby. The apothecary had huge eyebrows and wore tattered clothes and his shop had things like dried tortoises hanging from the ceiling, a stuffed alligator and the skins of odd-shaped fish. There were shelves of bottles, earthen pots, bottles and dried seeds ? bits of string and compressed rose petals were scattered everywhere. As he¡¯d passed it it had occurred to him that if a man ever needed a poison here¡¯s a man who would sell it to him ? even though there was a death penalty for doing so.
He would go there and persuade the apothecary to sell him some.

When he arrived the shop was shut so he stood in the street and looked up at the open window above it, ¡®Hey!¡¯ he called ¡®Apothecary!¡¯

A head appeared at the window. The man had enormous eyebrows ¡®Who¡¯s that shouting like that?¡¯

¡®Come down here, man ¡® said Romeo. He took a leather purse out of his pocket and shook it so that it clinked.
The man left the window and came to the door.

¡®Look here,¡¯ said Romeo. ¡®I can see you don¡¯t make a lot of money. I¡¯ll give you this
? forty gold coins ? if you¡¯ll give me just one dose of poison, something that will kill me as quickly as a bullet.¡¯

¡®I¡¯ve got some,¡¯ said the man ¡®But it¡¯s against the law.¡¯

¡®What¡¯s the matter?¡¯ said Romeo. ¡®So poor and wretched and you¡¯re afraid of dying? Look at you ? hungry, poor, down-trodden ? an outcast. The law isn¡¯t your friend, I can see that. Here, come on, take this. It¡¯s a lot of money and it¡¯ll make you rich.¡¯

The man grunted then grabbed the purse. ¡®It¡¯s only my poverty makes me do it,¡¯ he said.

¡®That¡¯s alright,¡¯ said Romeo. ¡®It¡¯s your poverty I¡¯m paying.¡¯

The apothecary went inside and came out again with a little bottle. ¡®Here. Drink it all. It would kill you even if you had the strength of twenty men.¡¯"
"Act 5, Scene 2","Friar Lawrence was humming. It was all working out well. Friar John would have delivered the letter to Romeo by now. It would be dark in a few hours and the whole business would soon be brought to a joyful conclusion. And here was Friar John now, just back from Mantua, making his way across the hillside. Brother John waved and when he came near enough he called out a greeting.

¡®Welcome, welcome, ¡® said Friar Lawrence. ¡®Welcome from Mantua. What did Romeo say? Or if he wrote to me give me his letter.¡¯

¡®I haven¡¯t been yet, I¡¯m afraid,¡¯ said Friar John, smiling. ¡®One of our friars was visiting the sick here in Verona and some officials came to find him because they thought he¡¯d caught some disease, and when they saw me with him they locked us both up in quarantine. I¡¯ve just got out, and I¡¯m on my way to Mantua now.¡¯

¡®Oh well, never mind,¡¯ said Friar Lawrence, ¡®As long as my letter got there. Who took it then?¡¯

Friar John rummaged among the folds of his habit and took out a crumpled letter.

¡®No-one,¡¯ he said. ¡®Here it is. I couldn¡¯t get anyone to deliver it. They were too scared of catching something.¡¯

¡®Oh hell!¡¯ said Friar Lawrence. ¡®If only you had known It was the most important letter. God, that¡¯s done it. Friar John, go and get a crow-bar and bring it straight to me. ¡®Run!.¡¯

Friar Lawrence watched his friend as he hurried off. He¡¯d have to go to the tomb on his own. Juliet was due to wake up in three hours¡¯ time. She would be angry that Romeo hadn¡¯t been told about it. But never mind he would write again and keep her in his chapel until Romeo came. It was a horrifying thought: Juliet waking up, a living corpse in a vault full of dead people."
"Act 5, Scene 3","Paris approached the churchyard, his page walking in front of him with the torch. The tombs of Verona¡¯s wealthiest families loomed even more darkly than their black surroundings.

¡®Give me my torch, boy,¡¯ said Paris. ¡®Then go and stand guard. No, on second thoughts, put it out: I don¡¯t want to be seen.¡¯ He looked about then pointed to a silent row of dark shapes, ¡®Go and lie under those yew trees and keep your ear to the ground. If you hear footsteps whistle. Give me those flowers. Go on, do as I tell you.¡¯

The page was terrified at being left alone in the churchyard but he did as he was told.

Paris moved slowly, step by cautious step in the dark, to Capulet ¡®s tomb. When he got to the entrance he lay the flowers in front of the doors. He had made up his mind that he would hold a vigil at the tomb and sprinkle perfumed water around the entrance. If not perfumed water then his own tears. And he would do that every night.

His page whistled. Someone was coming! Who could it be, coming to the graveyard at this time of night? And with a torch? The light came towards him. He would stand still and let the dark hide him. Whoever they were they were noisy. They virtually ran though the graveyard, not seeming to care whether anyone saw or heard them.

And then Paris heard a voice.

¡®Give me that pick axe and the crowbar,¡¯ the voice said. Then, ¡®Wait. Take this letter. Make sure you give it to my father in the morning.¡¯ There was another voice then the first one spoke again. ¡®Give me the light. Now listen. Whatever you see or hear, stay silent and don¡¯t interrupt me, whatever I¡¯m doing. I¡¯m going into this tomb, partly to look at her face, but mainly to get a ring from her finger ? a ring that I need for an important purpose. So, off you go. But listen. If you come back to pry into my business I¡¯ll tear you limb from limb and spread you around the churchyard. This is a desperate time and I ¡®m a desperate man ? more desperate than hungry tigers or roaring seas. So watch out.¡¯

¡®I¡¯m off,¡¯ said the second voice. ¡®I won¡¯t get in your way.¡¯

Paris recognized the first voice. It was that haughty, banished Montague ? the one who had murdered his love¡¯s cousin. It was the grief of that that had caused Juliet¡¯s death.

Romeo stood in front of the vault: it was a hideous stomach, stuffed with the sweetest food in the world. He would make it open its. jaws. He shoved the crowbar between the doors and forced them apart. He¡¯d cram that detestable stomach with more food.

Paris knew what the vile Montague was up to. The monster had come here to desecrate the bodies of those he had murdered. But he would stop him. He sprang out of the shadows.

¡®Stop, vile Montague!¡¯ he cried. ¡®How far are you going to take your vengeance? You¡¯re under arrest. Do as I tell you and come quietly. You¡¯ve got to die.¡¯ He took up a position between Romeo and the doors.

¡®Die?¡¯ said Romeo. He laughed. ¡®You¡¯re right. That¡¯s exactly what I came here for. Look here, gentle youth.¡¯ He spoke softly. ¡®Don¡¯t take on a desperate man. Just go away and leave me. Think about all the bodies in there and let them frighten you away.¡¯

He tried to pass but Paris refused to budge.

¡®I beg of you,¡¯ said Romeo. ¡®Don¡¯t tempt me to anger and make me commit another crime. Oh please go. Can¡¯t you see? I love you more than I love myself because I came here to do myself harm. Go. There¡¯s no need for this. Stay alive. And afterwards you¡¯ll be able to say that a madman took pity on you and allowed you to escape.¡¯

¡®No,¡¯ said Paris. ¡®And I¡¯m arresting you as a criminal.¡¯ He drew his sword.

¡®I¡¯m sorry if that¡¯s what you want,¡¯ said Romeo, drawing his rapier too.

Paris¡¯ page sprang up in alarm when he saw the two figures fighting. The torchlight threw up fantastical shadows as they squared up to each other among the tombs. The only thing he could think of was to go and find the Watch so he went off to do that.

The fight was short. Romeo did not want to hurt the young man but he knew that his assailant was deadly serious: he wouldn¡¯t give up and leave him to do what he had to. If he had the slightest opportunity this fellow would kill him before he had the chance to see his Juliet, so he had to make sure that didn¡¯t happen. He decided to keep his wits about him and take the young man seriously.

Within minutes Paris lay bleeding at the tomb¡¯s entrance. ¡®Oh, I¡¯m dying,¡¯ he said, gasping. ¡®If you have a heart lie me beside Juliet.¡¯

¡®I will,¡¯ said Romeo. Killing the young man was the last thing Romeo had wanted to do. He hadn¡¯t even recognized him in the dark graveyard. He brought the torch closer so that he could see the dead youth¡¯s face.

He was surprised when he saw who it was. He suddenly remembered what Balthasar had said as they galloped towards Verona. He hadn¡¯t been concentrating on Balthasar¡¯s words but he fancied Balthasar had told him that Paris was supposed to have married Juliet. Isn¡¯t that what Balthasar had said? Or had he dreamt it? Or was he mad, hearing the Count talk about Juliet like that, and imagined it? A huge sadness overwhelmed him at the thought that Paris had been caught up with them in this sour fate.

He propped the torch up in the vault then dragged the body in. As he stood up he saw Juliet lying on a marble bier. ¡®This is no grave, dead youth,¡¯ he said ¡®It¡¯s a lantern. Juliet ¡®s lying there and her beauty makes this vault a festive place full of light.¡¯

He lay Paris on the floor beside Juliet¡¯s bier. Then he brought the torch closer and climbed on to the bier. Looking at her he had a sudden feeling of happiness. He couldn¡¯t believe what little effect death had had on her beauty. Death hadn¡¯t defeated her ? her lips and cheeks were still rosy. He looked around the fearful place Tybalt lay on bier a few feet away. ¡®Tybalt,¡¯ he said, ¡®Is that you in your shroud? Oh what greater favour can I do you than kill myself, the man who was your enemy? Forgive me, cousin.¡¯

Why was she still so beautiful? Was it because Death was in love with her and was keeping her in that dark place as his mistress? If that was so he would stay there with her and never leave. He would join the worms that were her chamber-maids. This was where he would live forever.

But it was time. ¡®Eyes look your last,¡¯ he said. ¡®Arms take your last embrace.¡¯ He took her in his arms and raised her up. He kissed her. He lowered her again and took out the poison. It was time. ¡®Here¡¯s to my love!¡¯ He drank the poison in one go.

He had an immediate spasm. That apothecary knew what he was about: his poison was quick. He just had time to kiss Juliet again before he fell.

* * * * * * *

Friar Lawrence hurried towards the monument, stumbling against tombstones. There was a sound. He stopped. ¡®Who¡¯s there?¡¯

¡®It¡¯s me, Balthasar ¡® said Romeo¡¯s man. ¡®You know me.¡¯

¡®Oh, thank God,¡¯ said the Friar. ¡®Tell me, what¡¯s that light in Capulet¡¯s monument?¡¯

¡®It¡¯s my master,¡¯ said Balthasar.

¡®How long has he been in there?¡¯

¡®Half an hour,¡¯

¡®Come with me.¡¯ said the Friar.

¡®I can¡¯t. My master thinks I¡¯ve gone. He threatened me with terrible things if I didn¡¯t go.¡¯

¡®Stay here then,¡¯ said the Friar. ¡®I¡¯ll have to go by myself. I¡¯m so afraid ? oh so afraid that some evil thing¡¯s happened.¡¯

¡®I fell asleep under this tree here,¡¯ said Balthasar. ¡®And I dreamt my master and another man fought. And my master killed him.¡¯

Friar Lawrence went to the tomb¡¯s entrance and peered through the broken doors. ¡®Romeo!¡¯ he called. There was nothing but the echo of his own voice. He looked down and saw the two weapons lying in a pool of blood. He summoned up all his courage and entered the tomb.

Romeo¡¯s body lay across Juliet.

¡®So pale!¡¯ the Friar exclaimed. He saw Paris. ¡®Who¡¯s this? Oh no! All covered in blood? What¡¯s been going on here?¡¯ There was a deep sigh almost in his ear. Juliet was moving ? trying to sit up.

¡®Dear Friar,¡¯ she said. ¡®Where is my husband? I remember where I¡¯m supposed to be and here I am. Where is my Romeo?¡¯

There was the sound of voices in the distance. ¡®Someone¡¯s coming,¡¯ said the Friar. Come Juliet, come out of this nest of death and decay. A greater force than we can fight has spoilt our plans. Come away with me. Open your eyes and look: your husband¡¯s lying right there. And there¡¯s Paris too. Come on, quickly!. I¡¯ll take you to a convent. Don ¡®t argue. The Watch is coming.¡¯

He tried to pull her but she resisted. She put her arms around Romeo and clung to him. The Friar let go but he made one last attempt to persuade her. ¡®Please come, Juliet. I daren ¡®t stay any longer.¡¯

¡®You go,¡¯ said Juliet. ¡®I ¡®m staying here.¡¯

The voices were coming nearer. The Friar turned and fled. Juliet hugged Romeo and kissed him. She tried to hold his hand.

¡®What¡¯s this?¡¯ she said. ¡®A bottle?¡¯ She took it out of his closed hand and examined it, ¡®Poison. That¡¯s what killed him.¡¯ She raised it to her lips and tried to drink.

¡®Oh, the rascal!¡¯ she cried. ¡®Drunk every drop and left none for me? I¡¯ll take it from your lips: perhaps there¡¯s still some poison on them.¡¯ She kissed him and drew back immediately. ¡®Your lips are warm!¡¯ She cradled him and sobbed.

A man somewhere outside shouted, ¡®Show me, boy. Which way?¡¯

¡®They¡¯re here,¡¯ said Juliet¡¯. ¡®I must hurry. Oh thank God he¡¯s wearing his dagger. She drew the dagger, screwed up her eyes, and plunged it into her chest. ¡®This is your sheath,¡¯ she said. ¡®Rest there.¡¯

It had been effective. She couldn¡¯t breathe. It was painful but it would soon be all over ? her life was slipping away fast. ¡®And let me die,¡¯ she sighed.

The Watch came closer.

¡®There it is,¡¯ said Paris¡¯ page. ¡®Where the light is.¡¯

The captain of the Watch stopped at the entrance. ¡®Look at this blood,¡¯ he said. ¡®Search the churchyard. Arrest anyone you see.¡¯

They went in. When the captain saw the carnage even he, a hardened officer of the law, was appalled. ¡®You,¡¯ he said, ¡®Go tell the Prince. And you. Hurry, fetch the Capulets. Wake the Montagues up. The rest of you go and search for evidence.¡¯

They caught Balthasar and arrested him. They found the Friar trembling and crying. They took his crowbar as evidence and arrested him too.

By the time the Prince arrived, followed by the Capulets, the captain of the Watch had brought the three bodies out and lit the area with torches

¡®Oh heavens!¡¯ said Capulet. ¡®Oh wife.¡¯ They knelt down and cried without restraint. ¡®Oh look how he¡¯s bleeding,¡¯ said Capulet.

¡®This will take me to my grave,¡¯ said his wife. She lifted Juliet¡¯s lifeless body and held it close, rocking gently and moaning.

Montague arrived at the churchyard, followed by a member of the Watch. They hadn¡¯t told him what to expect.
¡®Good morning, Montague,¡¯ said the Prince, going to meet him. ¡®Up early to see your son down even earlier.¡¯ He spoke bitterly.

¡®A terrible night it¡¯s been,¡¯ said Montague. ¡®Terrible! my Lord. My wife died tonight. She couldn¡¯t bear it. Grief at my son¡¯s exile, and now I fear there¡¯s more unhappiness in store for me.¡¯

¡®Look there,¡¯ said the Prince. When Montague saw the dismal scene of slaughter he also began to weep. When he could speak he addressed the body of his son. ¡®Oh you bad mannered boy!¡¯ he said. ¡®To press before your father to the grave.¡¯

¡®Alright,¡¯ said the Prince. ¡®I¡¯m going to undertake a full inquiry into this sorry business. In the meantime, can anyone give me an idea of who¡¯s behind this disaster?¡¯

Friar Lawrence came forward fearfully.

¡®I¡¯m the one, Prince,¡¯ he said. ¡®I¡¯m responsible for this terrible slaughter. Here I stand, in an impossible dilemma, both condemning and excusing myself.¡¯

¡®Then tell us immediately what you know about it,¡¯ said the Prince, Friar Lawrence told his story as accurately and honestly as he could and at the end of it he offered his own life if the Prince should think he had done anything bad enough to warrant that.

The Prince wasn¡¯t inclined to judge him there and then. He wanted to look into it more fully and make a considered decision. ¡®We have always known you as a holy man,¡¯ he told the Friar. ¡®I think we¡¯d better hear what Romeo¡¯s man has to say.¡¯

Balthasar came forward nervously. He looked around. They were all there: Montague himself. And the Capulets. The Prince was regarding him sternly. ¡®I took the news of Juliet¡¯s death to my master,¡¯ he said. ¡®And he galloped here from Mantua: here, to this monument.¡¯ Balthasar took a letter out of his pocket and held it up He told me to take this to his father. He said he¡¯d kill me if I stayed here.¡¯

The Prince took the letter from him. ¡®I¡¯ll have a look at this,¡¯ he said. ¡®Where¡¯s Paris¡¯ page ? the one who called the Watch?¡¯

The page was no less nervous than Balthasar.

¡®Well?¡¯ said the Prince. ¡®What was your master doing here?¡¯

¡®He only brought flowers for his lady¡¯s grave,¡¯ said the page. ¡®He told the Prince what had happened¡¯. The Prince called for a torch and began reading the letter. Everyone waited for him to finish. At last he folded it. ¡®This letter confirms everything that everyone has told me,¡¯ he said. ¡®Capulet. Montague. Can you see what punishment you¡¯ve been given for your hatred? And because I¡¯ve turned a blind eye to your quarrels I¡¯ve also lost some of my own family. Everyone¡¯s been punished.¡¯

Capulet was aware of Montague weeping beside him. He thought of Montague¡¯s wife dying from grief at the banishment of her son: he remembered the pain of Tybalt¡¯s death, the way Juliet had shown her reluctance to marry Paris. He looked at the pitiful corpses on the ground in front of him. He turned to Montague. ¡®Oh brother Montague, give me your hand,¡¯ he said. ¡®This is long overdue. Forgive me.¡¯

¡®With all my heart,¡¯ said Montague. He took his old enemy¡¯s hand and the two men embraced.

¡®There¡¯s something I¡¯d like to do,¡¯ said Montague. ¡®I¡¯m going to commission a statue of Juliet in pure gold. From now on everyone will know that there could never be anyone as faithful and true as the beautiful Juliet.¡¯

¡®I¡¯ll match that,¡¯ said Capulet. ¡®I¡¯ll do the same for Romeo. They¡¯ll lie together forever, innocent victims of our quarrel.¡¯

¡®Alright,¡¯ said the Prince. ¡®I¡¯m pleased that you¡¯ve made your peace but it¡¯s time for bed. The sun¡¯s coming up. There it is, hiding behind the clouds, as though too sad to show itself. Go home, everyone, and I¡¯ll think it over. I¡¯m going to hold a proper inquiry. It¡¯s a serious business. There¡¯ll be punishment for some and pardons for others because there never was a story of more woe than this of Juliet and her Romeo.¡¯"
